"84893052541","The development of pre-salt fields in the Santos Basin has presented a plenty of technological challenges, which include the production of fluids with high values of GOR (Gas Oil Ratio) and high values of WAT (Wax Appearance Temperature). To avoid the wax deposition, it is absolutely imperative handling the temperature by insulation and/or heating. If in one hand the production system thermal insulation minimizes the heat losses to the environment, on the other hand the cooling due the thermodynamic effect of gas expansion is inevitable, mainly in fields with high GOR values. To mitigate the problem of temperature drop, mainly in the risers where the expansion effects are pronounced, various heating systems for subsea pipelines have been studied by PETROBRAS. In parallel to these studies, it was noted that the design philosophy of the offshore production units for the presalt fields have indicated the use of turbo-generators to supply electrical power to the production unit, leading to the opportunity of using the generated super heated gases, originally discharged into the atmosphere, in order to feed the riser heating systems based on heated fluids circulation. Studies of heat exchange performed indicated a great potential for the risers heating by the flow of heated water through the annular of a Pipe-in-Pipe riser, by using a WHRU (Waste Heat Recovery Unit) to recover the power discharged into the atmosphere from the turbo-generators. It was identified the possibility of heating Pipe-in-Pipe risers by circulating heated fresh water in a closed loop with water return to the production unit, or by coupling the riser heating system with the water injection system, using all the facilities for treatment and pumping of water injection. This paper aims to describe the methodology considered in the development of a conceptual design of a heating system for a Pipe-in-Pipe riser, by the flow of heated water in the annular, in a Free Standing Hybrid Riser configuration. The paper will also present the characteristics associated with the two possibilities of heated water circuit, as well as advantages and disadvantages of each system, and the aspects related to subsea production layout.

"85049552088","The continental shelf adjacent to the municipality of Salvador (CSS), state of Bahia, is the narrowest sector of the entire Brazilian continental shelf. During most of the Quaternary, this sector of the shelf was exposed to subaereous conditions, since sea level was approximately 45-60 meters below what is currently observed. This long subaereous exposure and resulting erosion were certainly controlled by the heterogeneity of the structural and stratigraphic framework of the Camamu and Jacuípe basins, highlighting relic physiographic features from both basins. The complex seascape that resulted from this prolonged erosion played an important role in controlling the characteristics of shelf sedimentation in episodes when the CSS was flooded during interglacial periods. The objective of the present study was to understand the geological evolution and the structural control of the Camamu /Jacuípe basins over sedimentation patterns of the Continental Shelf of Salvador, during the Quaternary, using seismic-stratigraphic interpretation of high-resolution shallow seismic lines obtained from a boomer plate sound source. Two major stratigraphic units were identified in the study area : the Cretaceous Sedimentary Basin and the overlapping Unconsolidated Quaternary Sediments. Isopach maps of Quaternary deposits and depth maps of the top of the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks showed that the structural framework of the Sedimentary Basin structurally controls shelf sedimentation. Compressional structures that affect the Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in areas near previously mapped transference faults seem to have originated topographic highs on the shelf where coarse bioclastic sedimentation predominates. These highs, in turn, delimitate low areas where fine-grained sediments accumulate. Shelf topographic highs are associated with antiforms in the Camaμ Jacuípe basins, with their most deformed strata following a WNW-SSE trend. This information is important to aid marine environmental management strategies. Moreover, the present study will allow the evaluation of the controlling factors that determinate narrow shelf sedimentation and stratigraphy, with small accommodation area, as in the case of the CSS. © 2017 IEEE.","Evaluation of the structural control over quaternary sedimentation on the continental shelf of Salvador, Bahia, using high-resolution seismic surveys","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",True,"2018"
"85083240666","Purpose: In order to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on carbon and nutrient accumulation, total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) accumulation rates were examined in a 210Pb-dated mangrove sediment core from Sepetiba Bay, Brazil, a coastal region impacted by multiple environmental changes during the previous century. Materials and methods: A 50-cm length sediment core was collected from a mangrove forest in Sepetiba Bay. Sediment subsamples were analyzed to measure TOC, TN, δ13C, and δ15N using an elemental analyzer attached to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer Thermo Finnigan Model Delta Plus XP, whereas colorimetric analysis were used to measure TP. For 210Pbex analyses, gamma-ray measurements were performed in a semiplanar intrinsic germanium high purity coaxial detector, coupled to a multichannel analyzer, whereas the sediment accumulation rate (SAR) was calculated according to the constant initial concentration (CIC) method. Also, carbon and nutrient fluxes were calculated using SAR and TOC, TN, and TP contents, whereas statistical differences were evaluated by ANOVA + Tukey HSD analysis with previous data normalization. Results and discussion: The calculated sedimentation rate (~ 8.1 mm year−1) since the early 1900s was up to threefold higher than the global mean determined for mangrove forests (~ 2.8 mm year−1) and the regional sea level rise (~ 3.2 mm year−1). Significantly higher TOC, TN, and TP fluxes, up to nearly 1000, 90, and 15 g m−2 year−1, respectively, were observed after the water diversion from a nearby drainage basin in the 1950s and an increase in sewage effluent input, which increased in the early 1990s. After this period, lighter δ13C values (~ − 25‰) indicate an increased importance of the terrestrial organic matter source, while lower TOC:TN ratios (~ 11) and heavier δ15N values (~ + 9‰) suggest an increased influence of anthropogenic fertilization on inorganic nitrogen accumulation. Conclusions: The significantly higher accumulation rates during the last decades evidenced the role of mangrove sediments as sinks for anthropogenically enhanced inputs of carbon and nutrients. Also, studies on carbon and nutrient accumulation evidenced the need for further research in eutrophic coastal areas. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon and nutrient accumulation in mangrove sediments affected by multiple environmental changes","Springer",True,"2020"
"85075879935","Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events with potential effects in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. During drought periods, higher salinity and temperature can directly impact estuarine benthic assemblages through physiological stress and alteration of sedimentary habitats, but these effects are poorly evaluated to date. Here we report a 14-month monitoring of benthic assemblages in a tropical estuary in the Eastern Brazil Marine Ecoregion during the severe drought period of 2015/2016. The drought in Eastern Brazil resulted in a decrease of estuarine mean sediment particle size and concurrent changes in macrofaunal benthic assemblages during the driest months. We also observed a 3-fold reduction on macrofaunal abundance with dominance of surface-dwelling Magelonid, Sternaspid, Capitellid and Oligochaeta annelids. The changes in macrofaunal structure during the severe drought also decreased the community bioturbation potential (BPc) by 5-fold, if compared to pre-drought periods. We argue that the projected increases in the frequency and severity of climatic events, such as observed during severe droughts worldwide, will greatly change the benthic fauna and their ecological functions in tropical estuarine ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drought effects on tropical estuarine benthic assemblages in Eastern Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2020"
"85048862831","Home to approximately four hundred thousand inhabitants and an important touristic center, the City of Santos is the largest seaport in South America. This coastal city is located in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Since 1979, an ocean outfall has been in use for combined sewage disposal from the City of Santos and neighboring City of São Vicente. The existing pipeline is 4.4 km long and 1.7 m in diameter. It is laid out within a relatively shallow depth of 10 m and its discharge capacity is 5.3 m3/s. Enhance primary treatment and increase the length of the outfall are alternatives in the study in order to improve the outfall system and deal with population increase and new environmental requirements. The fate and transport of sewage effluent, in light of proposed improvements of primary treatment and the augmentation of outfall's length are evaluated in this paper. Delft3D is used to simulate plume dispersion and other key variables. This is done while considering the non-steady nature of coastal hydrodynamics, tidal effects, wind, current speed, climate conditions, and other drivers. The modified dispersion processes for each alternative are presented and the results from a physical model of the Santos Bay and estuary are coupled to better represent the plume simulations. This research helps find that the proposed alternatives of enhanced primary treatment and a longer outfall give the answer to an improved disposal system that meets environmental requirements. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Capacity Expansion Study of the Santos Ocean Outfall, Brazil","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",True,"2018"
"85086808985","In the early years of the offshore industry, Early Production Systems or EPSs were extensively utilized to develop marginal and/or complex reservoirs in progressively deeper and more remote waters. Their signature attributes were low capital and operating costs, simple designs and accelerated schedules to first oil. Today, Operators are emphasizing capital efficiency, design simplicity, compressed discovery to first oil cycle times and de-risking subsurface uncertainty as deepwater projects compete for capital allocation with onshore shale projects. Discussing history and applications, the authors show, how an EPS can enable an Operator to sanction developments of marginal reservoirs, mid-size reservoirs with expansion capabilities to capture reservoir upsides and phased developments of giant reservoirs. This paper addresses major subsurface uncertainties impacting development decisions and strategies to gather relevant dynamic information to mitigate risk. It provides a brief history of EPSs deployed in the North Sea, Brazil and GoM including a database of EPS platforms based on an extensive literature review. A case history in each region to demonstrate the utility of an EPS to derisk and enable commercial production of marginal, mid-size and large fields. A discussion is presented for EPS platform selection based on the research of platforms deployed in the three major deepwater regions. This discussion will facilitate to develop a roadmap for the Operators and Development Planners with tools to rapidly deselect or retain options in the early development planning stage while there is a high degree of reservoir uncertainty and pressure to compress cycle time to first oil following a discovery.

"85044397080","In January 2000, Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro experienced a major oil spilling caused by a break down in one PETROBRAS oil pipeline. Over than 1.3 tons of fuel oil escaped into the bay water in the northern region. Studies of foraminiferal taphonomic assemblages in sediment samples collected on three periods in the same stations, before and after the spilling, were important for the pollution impact evaluation during eight years. In 2005, in the north region, TOC values were higher than in 1999. It was observed the increase of test abnormalities, corrosion and dwarfism. Abundance and species richness reduced in 2005 and increased in 2008 but they did not reach the 1999 levels. Trends of dominant species confirmed the increase of pollution values in 2005: Abundance of A. tepida increased while B. elegantissima reduced.

"85091725112","Lacustrine carbonate deposits mark the rift-sag sedimentation stage of the so-called pre-salt section of the Campos and Santos Basins, in the Southeast Brazilian continental shelf. These salt-sealed carbonate reservoirs form deep-water, giant and prolific oil fields that are currently responsible for approximately 70% of the Brazilian oil and gas production. In the Santos Basin, the sag stage carbonates are represented by the Aptian Barra Velha Formation, characterized by exotic textural and compositional features whose origin, development, and correlation with petrophysical properties have been broadly discussed in the last decade. A geological and petrophysical study has been performed based on core samples, plugs, and thin-sections of a well in the Barra Velha Formation from the eastern Santos Basin. The analyzed core interval was grouped into six depositional facies constituted by the association of five key textural components: (1) crystal shrubs; (2) calcite spherulites; (3) hybrid forms; (4) mud-grade carbonates and dolomite; and (5) intraclasts. The relationship between the depositional framework and the poroperm system, as evidenced by petrographic image analysis and CT-scan data, is highly complex. The depositional control over porosity is erratic, mainly due to the extensive diagenetic and possible hydrothermal overprint. Dolomite cementation, dolomitization, pervasive silicification, and dissolution processes are the main primary porosity modifiers. Petrophysical analysis indicates that intraclastic and spherulitic grainstones–rudstones, affected by matrix dissolution, may present the best reservoir properties, in certain intervals, even surpassing the shrubby framestones, which are widely regarded as the best reservoir facies. This study seeks to contribute to an emerging body of research about the Brazilian pre-salt lacustrine carbonates, broadening the geological knowledge about these deposit, while providing new data to improve hydrocarbon forecast and recovery. © 2020, Geologische Vereinigung e.V.

"85059218520","As a solution for sand production problems associated with the production of hydrocarbons from sandstone reservoirs, the gravel packing technique (GPT) has been used by Petrobras since the early seventies when some small offshore fields in northeast Brazil were completed with this technique. More recently Petrobras has made important discoveries in unconsolidated to friable turbidite sandstones in Campos Basin area, offshore Rio de Janeiro (fig.1). Carapeba, Vermelho and Pargo fields, the so called Northeastern Pole fields (NP fields); and Albacora and Marlim giants fields, located in deep waters, are among these important discoveries. The GPT has been elected as the only sand control technique suitable to those wells. The paper describes Petrobras search for improvement of GPT to suitably complete NP, Albacora and Marlim wells with this technique.

"85065623080","High concentrations of total arsenic (As), even above the Brazilian legislative threshold for marine sediments of 70 mg kg−1, were found in beach sands and near-shore surface sediments. Two mechanisms (anthropogenic activities and sedimentary processes in the coastal waters) are responsible for this contamination. The anthropogenic impact includes releases from metallurgical plants, phosphate fertilizer plants and gold and iron mining. In the coastal area sedimentary processes redistributed the As from the sediment into the porous structure of calcareous marine algae. These enriched calcareous algae are transported over time to the beach by wave action. As in the Brazilian coastal environment, increased As levels were also observed in other coastal environments of South America such as Rio Loa (Chile), Barbacoas Bay (Colombia) and the Southern Pampa region (Argentina). Finally, arsenic levels in fish from Brazilian coastal waters and North Sea, which is also an As-contaminated area, were compared.

"85028950368","There have been an increasing number of government policies and research activities aimed at the exploitation of renewable energy resources to diversify power supply and meet the growing demand for electricity. In the context of Brazil, an example of this is tidal energy, which has a significant potential and is mainly concentrated on the coast of the States of Maranhão, Pará, and Amapá. However, only a few studies have been conducted to evaluate and take advantage of this energy source. One of the works in progress involves the study of a tidal power plant installation at the dam situated at Bacanga. This paper outlines and analyzes the configuration management of a tidal power plant, which is suited to the current physical conditions of the dam and complies with operational and physical constraints. In specific terms, the study takes account the reservoir operating restrictions and available physical space for installing turbines. A recent assessment has been carried out that involves bathymetry, high-resolution photos, and 3-D scanning to evaluate the potential value of the reservoir. This allowed a complete reservoir characterization and the designing of its digital model.

"85061767810","The discovery of large oil accumulations in the rift and sag Pre-Salt sections of the Campos and Santos Basins has revived interest in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins. More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins. A study integrating systematic petrography, cathodoluminescence, scanning electron microscopy, microprobe and X-ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin. This study highlights the major primary, diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre-Salt succession, with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that influence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. The Pre-Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones, syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite, and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites. Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits. In the sag phase, stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites, which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits. In the rift section, stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites. Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution. Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution, neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift, as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites, silica and dolomite in the sag section. Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal fluids carried through faults and fracture systems. These fluids promote dolomitization, silicification, and dissolution at varying degrees and intensities. Eodiagenetic precipitation and dissolution owing to variations in the lake water chemistry and the episodic flow of hydrothermal fluids under burial conditions control the creation, redistribution, and obliteration of porosity in the Pre-Salt reservoirs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deposition, diagenetic and hydrothermal processes in the Aptian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the northern Campos Basin, offshore Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"

The global market and naval industry cannot meet the demand of the growing exploration activities, related to the recent discovery of new oil fields. Furthermore, they are located at a large distance from the shore (approximately 300km) and the environmental conditions are severe. These facts impose more logistics problems for materials and persons transportations. The retrofitting of vessels is an alternative for increasing their operability and this option has been studied by Transpetro, subsidiary of Petrobras responsible for the Ducts, Terminals, Maritime Transport and Natural Gas segments. This paper presents two real cases of retrofitting related to the application of new technologies for positioning, including Dynamic Positioning (DP) Systems or manually operated thrusters. In the first case, a conventional tanker will be converted to a DP2 tanker, in order to operate close to drill ships and to transfer fluids during the drilling operation. The second case is related to an offshore delivering vessel used for bunkering operation. This vessel is moored at a monobuoy, and up to 2 receiving vessels may be connected to it. An aft-azimuth thruster will be installed in the vessel, increasing its capacity to change heading in harsh environmental conditions and to keep a safe distance from the monobuoy during fast variations of environmental conditions. Both cases require the application of a comprehensive design methodology for thruster dimensioning. The retrofitting imposes tight constraints to the layout and positioning of the thrusters. Also, the proximity to others vessels and the harsh environmental conditions in the offshore fields requires a combination of static and dynamic calculation in order to evaluate power consumption and drift motions of the vessels.

"85102272621","Central Brazil hydroclimate is in the core region of the South American monsoon system. Thus, understanding precipitation variability in this area is crucial not only for the prediction of extreme events such as droughts and floods, but also for water resources management. Ocean teleconnections influence central Brazil precipitation from intraseasonal to interdecadal frequencies, in both linear and nonlinear ways, mainly during the austral summer. Pacific Ocean climate modes can influence South American precipitation, but how its variability changes over time is still a theme of scientific debate. Here we examined the influence of Pacific variability on summer precipitation in central Brazil during the last eight decades. We applied nonparametric spectral methods to four different observational datasets, and to AMIP-type precipitation outputs from the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique zoom model (LMDZ) in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phases 5 and 6 (CMIP5 and CMIP6) contributions of the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) coupled model. Our results showed an increase in amplitude and frequency of summer precipitation variability after the 1970s climate transition. Spectral analysis associated these changes to a transition in Pacific Ocean influence to central Brazil precipitation, from PDO- to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related variability after the 1970s climate transition.

This margin encompasses Northeastern Brazil, where most of the seismicity and active faults concentrate along the coast. The current study presents an integration of high-resolution aeromagnetic, seismological, and geological data to investigate the relationship between the seismicity and basement fabric in two areas in the northern part of the Precambrian Borborema Province. Our investigation indicates a relation between the metamorphic basement foliation and two seismogenic faults. In the first area adjacent to the Transbrasiliano Lineament, the largest continental suture zone in the South American platform, the magnetic anomaly patterns indicate that the regional basement grain and structural elements are E-W-oriented, which coincides with the strike of the E-W-striking, strike-slip Riacho Fundo Seismogenic Fault. In the second area, the magnetic anomaly patterns also coincide with the NE-SW-striking, strike-slip Samambaia Fault, and a swarm of chalcedony-quartz veins. Euler deconvolution used to estimate the source depth of the magnetic anomalies indicates that the faults in both cases could be longer and deeper than segments illuminated by the present-day seismicity.

"84857324711","In the 90's, after success in drilling wells deeper than 5,000 meters with high production rates between 80 to 120 MMSCFD of production, Petrobras decided to continuously measure pressure on their high productivity wells (7"" production tubing) because of the difficulty they experienced when running gauges in the production mode after the wells were completed. Therefore, the decision was made to use permanent electronic gauges to obtain downhole pressure as it was a proven technology and optical sensing technology (fiber optics) was new to the industry. At that time, four wells in the San Antonio and San Alberto fields were completed with electronic gauges with different results....one did not work, one failed at the beginning, one failed months later, and one worked intermittently. Petrobras' objective to have real time downhole pressure did not change, and they planned for the next workovers of their wells to use optical sensing technology instead of electronic gauges. These specifications were required on their next bid, and the four wells were assigned to Weatherford International. Since that time, this technology is working in the four wells in the San Antonio and San Alberto fields, and there have only been small problems on surface equipment connections, which were corrected promptly. Because of this success, Petrobras decided last year to implement optical sensing technology in all of their new wells because it was the only proven technology that could support the high vibration, produced by the 7'' tubing wells, and high temperature. The decision was taken one step further to install fiber optic downhole flowmeters on the intelligent completion wells. The use of this technology, complemented with the online PanSystem™ well test analysis software, enables real time well testing.

The particle size and organic matter content in most of the analyzed stations showed features not conducive to the accumulation of pollutants due to the low organic matter content and the strong presence of sand fraction. There was also the fractionation of heavy metals in sediments and it was found the prominence of residual and reducible phase, besides the significant occurrence of organic fractions in some analyzed stations. These factors, thus, highlight the potential risks of contamination, where the metals associated with the organic phase can become bioavailable in processes of dissolution, provided by physico-chemical changes that can occur in this aquatic environment.","Study of heavy metal concentration and partitioning in the Estrela River: Implications for the pollution in Guanabara Bay-SE Brazil",NULL,True,"2011"

In establishing this record, the piles were driven to maximum penetration of 110 m. The jacket, designed by Interconsult (Micoperi), presented a new concept for steel jackets using vertical external skirt piles. The concept eliminated the need for pile guides and enabled the 160-m-long piles to be installed and driven in a single piece. This permitted fast installation in an area of the open South Atlantic subject to severe seas of long period swells almost the entire year.

"85099211729","Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable used for ocean and weather monitoring and forecasting. The NOAA’s next generation geostationary satellite GOES-16 was declared operational at the east position (75◦W) in December 2017, carrying onboard an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The hyperspectral ABI sensor now allows SST estimates every 10–15 min at both day and nighttime, with advanced options for cloud screening and water vapor correction. In the present work, we compare the first operational ABI SST product (OSI SAF, 2018) with an in situ match-up database (MDB) across the Tropical and Southwestern Atlantic Ocean, off the Brazilian coast, throughout the year of 2018. The MDB was obtained from two long-term programs, i.e., PIRATA moored buoys (FOLTZ et al., 2016) and PNBoia moored and drifting buoys (MARINHA DO BRASIL, 2017). Separate comparisons were made for each data set, analyzing the uncertainties according to the program (i.e., buoy type and region), satellite SST quality level and influence of diurnal heating. We also compare the ABI product with the OSTIA analysis L4 SST (DONLON et al., 2012) to increment our analyses on the spatio-temporal biases within the study region. The results show that the OSI SAF ABI SST L3C has a mean bias (0.1◦C) and error (RMSE, 0.5◦C) within the GHRSST standards, with an exception being coastal waters off the southeast Brazilian coast (RMSE, 0.65◦C), which are subjected to sharp thermal fronts. The highest biases are for regions/seasons subjected to persistent cloud coverage and high water-vapor content, i.e., the Intertropical and South Atlantic Convergence Zones, as well as highly dynamic frontal zones, i.e., the Brazil Malvinas Confluence Zone, the Subtropical Front and coastal waters.

"85050539655","Petrobras launched the PDBC (Campos Basin Development Plan) as part of Company's Strategic Plan to increase production and incorporate reserves in a scenario of mature fields and low oil prices. The plan is based on an integrated analysis of opportunities, combining skills of professionals with different backgrounds, allowing cost reduction and the deployment of technical solutions. It also has defined shortand long-term actions to achieve these goals. In the short-term horizon, actions included campaigns to remove damage of producer and injector wells, improvements in artificial lift methods, reduction of time required for projects approval, early drilling of wildcats, improvements in the efficiency of water injection, among others. In the long term, Petrobras performed a critical analysis of the recovery factor for each reservoir, identifying bottlenecks and evaluating technological solutions with multidisciplinary teams. Results indicate a significant increase in production in 2017 and the proposal of new projects in these fields. This paper presents the methodology used in the program and the results obtained so far for the giant oil fields of Roncador, Marlim Sul, Marlim Leste, Barracuda, Caratinga and Albacora Leste, responsible for approximately 20% of all Brazilian production.

"85055528846","In drilling vessels, the dynamic positioning (DP) system has great importance for the operation, since it ensures the station keeping ability for carrying out the drilling operation. However, an emergency situation involves ungoverned drift due to problems associated with the DP system failures, such as thrusters, generators, powerbus or control system. During this emergency situation, the vessel drift is subjected to the influence of environmental conditions and the drift can lead to collisions with floating obstacles or submerged systems, wellhead emergency disconnection, damage to equipments and potentially causing major environmental disasters. Due to the possible occurrence of this emergency condition, it is necessary to define a safety region for the drilling ship operation and to determine the limiting operation offset that the drilling vessel can disconnect from the wellhead without damage to any equipment. This limit offset is obtained through a riser analysis and drift-off study, being an important input for WSOG (Well Specific Operating Guidelines). The study will provide vessel drift trajectory after the DP failure under several environmental conditions. A validated time domain simulator must be used for obtaining such data. In the present work, the Dynasim software, developed from the partnership between Petrobras and Brazilian universities, is applied. Thus, the aim of this work is to validate the Dynasim numerical model using drift data from full scale tests performed on vessels operated by Petrobras and under several environmental conditions. For the validation and calibration of the numerical model, three main parameters were compared: distance time-series, heading variation and trajectory during the drift of the vessel. The comparisons between full scale data and numerical simulation results demonstrated the accuracy of the numerical model. Therefore, the application of this tool provides a valuable contribution to the reliability of WSOG analysis, planning of the operations, allowing the determination of the drift path in relation to the wind, current and waves, and the definition of drift maps and establishing safety zones for the drilling vessel operation, minimizing the risk of collisions.

"85085776372","Evaluation of characteristic values of geotechnical parameters is associated with uncertainties inherent to the geological processes that change soil strata. Statistical analysis of soil data allows one to deal rationally with these uncertainties. The present work addresses some normative recommendations and literature models for statistical characterization of undrained shear strength and submerged unit weight in offshore soils, providing more information to conductor casing design. Three methodologies were selected for the analysis. The NORSOK G-001 (2004) standard recommends the use of mean values computed conservatively. Lacasse et al. (2007) propose that characteristic value should be the mean value minus half a standard deviation of the parameter under analysis. DNV-RP-C207 (2012) suggests different methodologies for dependent and independent soil variables, though both methods of calculating the characteristic value involve linear regressions. Using data from geotechnical investigations that characterize eight oil wells located in two Brazilian offshore basins, the selected methodologies were applied to obtain the characteristic values and compared to each other. The analysis is carried out with data from seventeen CPTu tests associated to the eight wells abovementioned. It is noted that the NORSOK recommendation leads to the highest characteristic values, which are assumed tending to the mean value of the dataset over the well depth. The values obtained using Lacasse et al. (2007) methodology are more conservative and stand as a lower bound of the NORSOK methodology. The models suggested by DNV perform differently when applied to the geotechnical parameters. The dependent variables methodology fits both undrained strength and unit weight accurately. Analysis shows that undrained strength is better described using the methodology for standard deviation proportional to the depth while, for the unit weight, accurate results are obtained by using constant standard deviation. The lower bound procedure proposed by DNV provides, in general, non-conservative results in the first meters and more conservative values along the depth when compared with the other methodologies. Regarding all the formulations addressed, differences between them increase for wells whose CPTu data present higher dispersion. This larger dispersion suggests applications of different statistical-based approaches in order to reliably characterize offshore soil data. The datasets analyzed comprise different levels of scattering and soil heterogeneity, and comparing the statistical recommendations brings additive information for the designer to set the characteristic values of soil properties, aiming for the decision-making process on top hole drilling applications, e. g. conductor casing design. To the authors' knowledge, few papers perform this comparative analysis. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Comparison of methodologies for statistical evaluation of characteristic soil properties for top hole design","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"84880007809","Blubber samples from three delphinid species (false killer whale, Guiana and rough-toothed dolphin), as well as liver samples from franciscana dolphins were analyzed for dioxins and related compounds (DRCs). Samples were collected from 35 cetaceans stranded or incidentally captured in a highly industrialized and urbanized area (Southeast and Southern Brazilian regions). Dioxin-like PCBs accounted for over 83% of the total TEQ for all cetaceans. Non-ortho coplanar PCBs, for franciscanas (82%), and mono-ortho PCBs (up to 80%), for delphinids, constituted the groups of highest contribution to total TEQ. Regarding franciscana dolphins, significant negative correlations were found between total length (TL) and three variables, σTEQ-DRCs, σTEQ-PCDF and σTEQ non-ortho PCB. An increasing efficiency of the detoxifying activity with the growth of the animal may be a plausible explanation for these findings. This hypothesis is reinforced by the significant negative correlation found between TL and PCB126/PCB169 concentration ratio. DRC concentrations (ng/g. lipids) varied from 36 to 3006, for franciscana dolphins, as well as from 356 to 30,776, for delphinids. The sum of dioxin-like and indicator PCBs varied from 34,662 to 279,407. ng/g. lipids, for Guiana dolphins from Rio de Janeiro state, which are among the highest PCB concentrations ever reported for cetaceans. The high concentrations found in our study raise concern not only on the conservation of Brazilian coastal cetaceans, but also on the possibility of human health problem due to consumption of fish from Brazilian estuaries. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","High accumulation of PCDD, PCDF, and PCB congeners in marine mammals from Brazil: A serious PCB problem",NULL,True,"2013"
"85096833213","Manganese (Mn) is an abundant element in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems and an essential micronutrient in the metabolic processes of plants and animals. Mn is generally not considered a potentially toxic element due to its low content in both soil and water. However, in coastal ecosystems, the Mn dynamic (commonly associated with the Fe cycle) is mostly controlled by redox processes. Here, we assessed the potential contamination of the Rio Doce estuary (SE Brazil) by Mn after the world's largest mine tailings dam collapse, potentially resulting in chronic exposure to local wildlife and humans. Estuarine soils, water, and fish were collected and analyzed seven days after the arrival of the tailings in 2015 and again two years after the dam collapse in 2017. Using a suite of solid-phase analyses including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequential extractions, our results indicated that a large quantity of MnII arrived in the estuary in 2015 bound to Fe oxyhydroxides. Over time, dissolved Mn and Fe were released from soils when FeIII oxyhydroxides underwent reductive dissolution. Due to seasonal redox oscillations, both Fe and Mn were then re-oxidized to FeIII, MnIII, and MnIV and re-precipitated as poorly crystalline Fe oxyhydroxides and poorly crystalline Mn oxides. In 2017, redox conditions (Eh: −47 ± 83 mV; pH: 6.7 ± 0.5) favorable to both Fe and Mn reduction led to an increase (~880%) of dissolved Mn (average for 2015: 66 ± 130 µg L-1; 2017: 582 ± 626 µg L-1) in water and a decrease (~75%, 2015: 547 ± 498 mg kg−1; 2017: 135 ± 80 mg kg−1) in the total Mn content in soils. The crystalline Fe oxyhydroxides content significantly decreased while the fraction of poorly ordered Fe oxides increased in the soils limiting the role of Fe in Mn retention. The high concentration of dissolved Mn found within the estuary two years after the arrival of mine tailings indicates a possible chronic contamination scenario, which is supported by the high levels of Mn in two species of fish living in the estuary. Our work suggests a high risk to estuarine biota and human health due to the rapid Fe and Mn biogeochemical dynamic within the impacted estuary. © 2020","Manganese: The overlooked contaminant in the world largest mine tailings dam collapse","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2021"
"85055255571","The oil industry's search for new hydrocarbon accumulations has led to the drilling of ever deeper wells, normally under harsh conditions that involve high pressures, temperatures and mechanical strengths as well as sour gas production.

"2342623297","A discussion covers the three consecutive PROCAP programs. They are the engineering programs that the state owned Petrobras developed with respect to exploitation in ultra deep waters. Five factors that have been decisive for success in the exploitation of petroleum in deep and ultra deep waters in the Campos basin of Brazil are addressed. The present configuration of the program with some details of the program systemics is described. Three of the most difficult technologies to perfect in deep water are considered. The topics relate to the potential of the resources of oil and gas in the deep waters of Brazil; the motivation and focus on the deep waters to extract oil and gas with the success of Petróbras in doing so; the success of Petróbras in deep water exploration as due to its association with industry to resolve all engineering obstacles; the principal achievements of PROCAP as involving the acquisition of FPSO and semi-submersibles technology; PROCAP-3000, launched in June 2000 to discover and exploit fields at 3000 m depth; sub sea system of warm-up of piping and electric pumps; sub sea system to separate water from oil and gas; and conclusions. PROCAP1000, active in 1986-1991, dealt with exploitation at depths of 1000 m. PROCAP-2000, active in 1992-1999, dealt with exploitation in waters of 2000 m depth. The PROCAP-3000 program is active in the period 2000-2005 at depths of 3000 m.

"85071023764","Many estuaries present natural harbor conditions with relatively calm and shallow waters that provide a connection between the ocean and continental waterways. The increase in the demand for goods by the constant growing of the world population has forced estuaries to be altered by human activities, such as dredging, in order to maintain a safe navigation system. The development of sophisticated morphological and hydrodynamic models opened a new perspective of assisting dredging operations inside different estuaries. Thus, the aim of this study is to apply a hydromorphodynamic model to simulate the bed evolution of the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil. The results of the simulation were applied in a dredge operation model to simulate dredging inside the waterway of the Rio Grande harbor, located inside the Patos Lagoon estuary. The salinity and current velocities inside the estuary were well represented by the model simulations. An annual mean discharge of 3 407 ms3 s−1 was calculated for the lagoon for the year 2004. The morphodynamic model successfully represented the silted and eroded scenarios for the estuarine channel. The dredge operation model results affirm that dredging of the channel causes significant variations in estuarine physical parameters such as salinity, current velocity and suspended sediment concentration. The bed evolution results indicate that a fast siltation of the channel occurs right after dredging stops, stabilizing the variations after a 60-day period. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Impacts of dredging on the hydromorphodynamics of the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2019"

"85092110011","Turbulent air–sea heat fluxes were computed from in situ high-frequency micrometeorological data during two research cruises performed in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SWAO) occurring in June 2012 and October 2014. Two different and dynamical areas were covered by the cruises: the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence (BMC) and the Southern Brazilian Continental Shelf (SBCS). The eddy covariance (EC) method was used to estimate the air–sea sensible- and latent-heat fluxes. This article compares these novel high-frequency estimates of heat fluxes with bulk parametrizations made at the same location and time from independent measurements taken on board the ships. When comparing the EC and bulk-estimated time series of sensible-heat fluxes, we found a good agreement both in their magnitude and variability, with small bias (generally &lt;20 W·m−2) between the datasets from the two study areas in the SWAO. However, the EC and bulk latent-heat flux comparisons show large biases ranging from 75 W·m−2 to 100 W·m−2 in the SBCS and BMC, respectively. These biases were always associated with short-term, high-frequency environmental perturbations occurring either in the atmosphere or in the ocean with the majority related to strong wind burst events and large air–sea temperature gradients. The short period changes in atmospheric conditions were mostly related to the passage of transient synoptic systems over the two study areas. The large air–sea temperature gradients were mostly linked to the surface characteristics of the BMC and SBCS regions, where sharp oceanographic fronts are located. Our results are able to contribute to improving weather and climate simulations of the mid- to high latitudes of South America, a region largely influenced by the sea-surface temperature patterns of the SWAO in combination with the frequent propagation of transient atmospheric systems. © 2020 Royal Meteorological Society","Observations of air–sea heat fluxes in the southwestern Atlantic under high-frequency ocean and atmospheric perturbations","John Wiley and Sons Ltd",True,"2020"

The name of this project is PDET. This project comprises of a fixed central pumping station, PRA-1, a large FSO (2,1 million barrels storage capacity), and two calm buoys systems, at a depth of 100 m. The start-up of this project involves the crude oil from three producing platform; P-52, P-51 and P-53, which are all currently under advanced construction. In the future PDET will receive the production of crude oil from two additional new platforms. Each producing platform will have its own export pipeline, direct to PRA-1. The peak production of this system will achieve 600,000 bbl/day. PRA-1 will have special requirements to pump crude oil either to FSO or to the calm buoys systems. Based on a steel jacket structure the capacity of power generation will be 75 MW, up to 34 inches pigging capacity and many diverse pipings. The FSO has special specifications such as the electrical power and optical swivels, both are at a high level of technology and capacity. To achieve system's targeted reliability extensive studies were done. Integrity protection system, leak detection system, offloading time, sub-sea layout and flow rates were taken into consideration.

"84984596158","Southeastern Brazilian marine coastal deposits provide an excellent opportunity to investigate environmental changes such as sea level and trophic variability during the Holocene period. In this study, we present a sediment record from Arraial do Cabo Bay, Rio de Janeiro State. In order to improve the understanding of the upper subtidal palaeoecosystem evolutionary dynamics of this Bay, we provide a microfacies analysis of Holocene carbonate and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposits cropping out today from the supratidal to the subtidal zones. The age-depth model is based on 14C dating and revealed a basal age of ~ 7000 cal. years BP. In the six distinguished microfacies, the biogenic components are dominated by vermetids and coralline algae. A number of subordinate components are also present, including the microfacies determining thin-shelled bivalves. Fossil vermetids are represented by monospecific clusters of overgrowing Petaloconchus varians. Coralline red algae are represented by Lithophyllum pustulatum, Spongites fruticulosus, Spongites yendoi, Mesophyllum engelharti, and unidentified geniculate corallines. The microfacies analysis revealed that the substrate of the benthic community in the upper subtidal ecosystem of the Bay changed according to the relative sea level: (1) during the rapid sea transgressive trend it was coarse soft substrate, (2) after the postglacial sea level maximum succeeding a slow decline to present sea level it changed into fine soft substrate.

"85016958402","The economy of Brazil has the potential to further develop its existing maritime cabotage services by promoting a modal shift from the road to the sea. The road represents the biggest share in the Brazilian transport matrix, but the larger waterborne participation represents lower logistics costs and greater environmental benefits. This paper investigates cabotage users' perception and priorities in integrating cabotage into their multimodal transport systems. It analyses the cabotage and transport choice body of literature, the outcome of which was applied to 326 potential domestic cabotage users through an email survey questionnaire made up of open and closed questions, which resulted in 30 answers suitable for analysis by univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. The 59 service attributes identified were grouped into 13 factors, which explained 89.6% of the modal choice. The conclusions show that cabotage users aim to enhance the integration of logistics between transport modes and to adopt modal shift strategies if better services could be provided, including a real-time information system, shorter transit times and freight offered on a door-to-door basis.

"85086829622","Volcanic oceanic islands host soils that may hold important paleo-environmental proxies, based on vegetation and faunal evidences coupled with pedological and geomorphological indicators. In this regard, the main Brazilian oceanic island of Fernando de Noronha (FNI) still lacks a deeper and more complete analysis of its climatic history and soil evolution. We select and collect representative FNI soils to interpret their chemical, physical and mineralogical properties and to explain their changing pedogenesis and geomorphic balance, aiming at revealing the environmental and landscape evolutionary history of this island. Ten soil pedons on phonolites, ankaratrites and the associated pyroclastic rocks were collected in June/2018. Six profiles were classified as Inceptisols, one as Entisol, one as Mollisol, one as Vertisol and another as the first Oxisol ever described in a Brazilian oceanic island. The pH ranged between 5.0 and 6.0 in the more developed, dystrophic and Al-saturated soils, whereas alkaline pHs were found in the eutrophic and Na-rich pedons. For the latter group, chemical and physical attributes are closely associated with the parent material composition, whereas in the former, present day soil features overprint paleoweathered regoliths and former pedogenetic processes. High concentrations of available phosphorus (P) were observed in all soils and horizons, even at depths greater than 150 cm, and P forms were detected as amorphous or poorly-crystalline phosphates (Al, Fe, Na, Ca and K). High- and low-activity clay minerals coexist, combined with gibbsite and unstable primary minerals, indicating the polygenetic nature of FNI soils. A combined pedogeomorphological analysis indicated the existence of a high paleoweathered plateau with relict soils, and erosional surfaces hosting younger soils. Results showed the succession of at least three distinct main paleoclimates since the Pliocene and a post-magmatic model for landscape evolution. The unreported, widespread and intense phosphatization of all soils and paleosurfaces is attributed to a past large population of birds nesting all over the island, corroborating old historical records of the island's early occupation.

The Pirabas Formation from the Aricuru outcrop (Pará State) is a shallow-water mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposit, comprising highly bioturbated wackestone and packstone. However, the impact of these biogenic structures on the reservoir quality of this formation has been overlooked. Here, our results show that pervasive Thalassinoides penetrating the rock matrix, result in remarkably improved porosity and permeability, thus, turning the Pirabas Formation in extremely favorable strata for fluid flow and storage. Since these bioturbated layers are likely to be common in the sub-surface counterparts of this formation, the hydrocarbon potential of these deposits is probably higher than previously expected. Also, considering that the offshore basins of Northern Brazil are directly related to the breakup of the African and American plates during Aptian-Albian, the exploratory interest in the correlated Guinea Gulf (Jubilee play) and French Guiana-Suriname Basin (Zaedyus play) need to be reconsidered.

"85035340277","We investigate the carbon dynamics in Guanabara Bay, an eutrophic tropical coastal embayment surrounded by the megacity of Rio de Janeiro (southeast coast of Brazil). Nine sampling campaigns were conducted for dissolved, particulate and total organic carbon (DOC, POC and TOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), chlorophyll a (Chl a), pheo-pigments and ancillary parameters. Highest DOC, POC and Chl a concentrations were found in confined-shallow regions of the bay during the summer period with strong pCO2 undersaturation, and DOC reached 82 mg L−1, POC 152 mg L−1, and Chl a 800 μg L−1. Spatially and temporally, POC and DOC concentrations varied positively with total pigments, and negatively with DIC. Strong linear correlations between these parameters indicate that the production of TOC translates to an equivalent uptake in DIC, with 85% of the POC and about 50% of the DOC being of phytoplanktonic origin. Despite the shallow depths of the bay, surface waters were enriched in POC and DOC relative to bottom waters in periods of high thermohaline stratification. The seasonal accumulation of phytoplankton-derived TOC in the surface waters reached about 105 g C m−2 year−1, representing between 8 and 40% of the net primary production. The calculated turnover time of organic carbon was 117 and 34 days during winter and summer, respectively.

The Seillean, a dynamically positioned vessel on contract to Petrobras, was used as the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel. To prepare for production, the development team needed to evaluate the requirements for an FPSO vessel and develop the limits required by the processing system. Petrobras chose the Seillean as the central vessel in the life-of-field production system. FPSO equipped for test and early production operations in ≤ 2000-m water depth. The FPSO is self-contained with a full-size derrick to handle the rigid production riser and subsea equipment.

A DP Class 1 shuttle tanker is required in Brazilian waters for export of crude for operations in environments with significant wave heights ≤ 5.5 m. A mooring hawser connects the DP FPSO and the DP shuttle tanker, allowing a flexible, floating hose system to offload crude to a shuttle tanker.

"77958012173","The practicability of estimating directional wave spectra based on a vessel 1s t order response has been recently addressed by several researchers. The interest is justified since on-board estimations would only require only a simple set of accelerometers and rate-gyros connected to an ordinary PC. The on-board wave inference based on 1st order motions is therefore an uncomplicated and inexpensive choice for wave estimation if compared to wave buoys and radar systems. The latest works in the field indicate that it is indeed possible to obtain accurate estimations and a Bayesian inference model seems to be the preferable method adopted for performing this task. Nevertheless, most of the previous analysis has been based exclusively on numerical simulations. At Polytechnic School, an extensive research program supported by Petrobras has been conducted since 2000, aiming to evaluate the possibility of estimating wave spectrum on-board offshore systems, like FPSO platforms. In this context, a series of small-scale tests has been performed at the LabOceano wave basin, comprising long and short crested seas. A possible candidate for on-board wave estimation has been recently studied: a crane barge (BGL) used for launching ducts offshore Brazil. The 1:48 model has been subjected to bow and quartering seas with different wave heights and periods and also different levels of directional spreading. A Bayesian inference method was adopted for evaluating the wave spectra based on the time-series of motions and the results were directly compared to the wave spectra measured in the basin by means of an array of wave probes. Very good estimations of the statistical parameters (significant wave height, peak period and mean wave direction) were obtained and, in most cases, even the directional spreading could be properly predicted. Inversion of the mean direction (180° shift), mentioned by some authors as a possible drawback of the Bayesian inference method, was not observed in any case. Sensitivity analysis on errors in the input parameters, such as the vessel inertial characteristics, has also been performed and attested that the method is robust enough to cope well with practical uncertainties. Overall results once again indicate a good performance of the inference method, providing an important additional validation supported by a large set of model tests.

The SSVBES located at 24.0∘S, 46.3∘W is a complex estuarine system with many interconnected channels and two connections with the open sea. The system is prone to storm tides that bring coastal flooding to and interrupt ship traffic through Santos Port. The SOFS hydrodynamic module is based on the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) version POM-rain. The SSVBES model grid is forced by tides, winds, and river runoff and is nested into a coarse-resolution South Brazil Bight (SBB) grid. The SBB grid is forced by winds, density gradients, and the Brazil Current flowing offshore. Within SSVBES, SOFS works in parallel with three real-time observation stations. The model performance was tested against observed data with a best Willmott skill of 0.97 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 13.0 cm for tidal sea level (15.9% of the mean tidal range). For tidal currents, the best skill and RMSE were above 0.99 and 3.9 cm/s (4.3% of the mean tidal current range), respectively.

"85071542084","Several Mesozoic successions of the Southern Tethyan margin were accumulated on a carbonate platform evolving to pelagic plateau depositional systems. Rifting paleotectonics was the main process conditioning their tectono-sedimentary evolution. The well-exposed outcrops in NW Sicilian fold and thrust belt of the so-called Trapanese carbonate platform to pelagic succession highlight the occurrence of lateral facies and thickness changes, paleofaults, volcanics, and resedimented deposits. The integration of facies analysis, stratigraphic data, and subsidence history have permitted to decipher the polyphase tectono-sedimentary evolution and to distinguish different depositional settings. Structural lows, filled with up to 100m-thick of pillow lavas and reworked deposits, appear as intraplatform basins bordered by structural highs, as horst ridges, characterised by condensed sedimentation, and isolated seamounts. These sectors were linked among them by stepped fault margins, scalloped margins and depositional slopes. The tectonic history, highlighted by the backstripped sections, reveals superimposed evolutionary stages reflecting rifting and rapid tectonic subsidence, leading to continental break-up (Late Triassic-Early Jurassic stage); the Middle Jurassic stage reflects slow thermal subsidence in the basin shoulders and higher rates in the intervening depressions; the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous regional uplift interrupts the thermal subsidence curve trend. The tract of the Late Cretaceous-Eocene curve suggests again slow thermal post-rift subsidence, also influenced by sediment load. The different subsidence curves, reconstructed from different positions in the sedimentary basin, demonstrate that its evolution could be driven by the identified syn-sedimentary faults that were formed and/or re-activated during several tectonic events encompassing the whole Jurassic-Cretaceous time period. The regional significance of this tectonics indicates that the Sicilian sector of the Southern Tethyan continental margin was tectonically active for the whole Mesozoic. The reconstructed paleophysiography of the Trapanese continental margin, during the Mesozoic, appears characterized by a segmented and drowned carbonate platform with morphostructural highs separated by deep channels. The comparison to the present-day morphostructural setting of some regions of the Atlantic continental margins (e.g. Caribbean, Brazilian Equatorial Margin), suggests also for the study region that the occurrence of transcurrent/transform faults and stretching of the continental lithosphere can have played an important role in determining the physiographic conformation. © Società Geologica Italiana, Roma 2019.","Mesozoic tectono-sedimentary evolution of the Trapanese Southern Tethyan margin (NW Sicily), integrating facies and stratigraphic analysis with subsidence history","Societa Geologica Italiana",True,"2020"
"84897376128","Drilling operations in salt zones have gained importance in Brazil due to the discovery of large oil and gas reserves in the Pre-Salt area. Thus, the pursuit of excellence in such operations is requiring considerable development of new operational practices and technologies. Synthetic base mud has been the first choice to drill through evaporite sections in Pre-Salt zones. Synthetic fluids application practically eliminates salt dissolution and improves caliper quality. However, depending on the salt mobility rate, stuck bit and/or stuck pipe can happen, demanding the injection of fresh water pills for its liberation. In some wells, the frequent use of those pills resulted in enlarged sections. The situation gets worse in scenarios where loss of circulation is a major issue. On the other hand, the use of non-saturated aqueous fluids to drill soluble salts (e.g. halite, tachyhydrite and carnalite) can result in localized enlargements due to leaching process. Drilling a gauge hole is a very important issue to prevent wellbore collapse and/or problems in cementing operations. However, high operating costs associated to deep water drilling is placing additional emphasis on drilling performance in order to reduce the operational time, without losing the quality of the wells. This concern raises the issues of how to most effectively improve operational performance regarding the drilling fluid selection. The paper presents the results of the use of water based muds in the drilling of two offshore wells in Brazilian Pre-Salt area and highlights the lessons learned from the experience. Before the field application extensive lab tests and numerical simulations were carried out to support the drilling fluid design for the wells. In the first well, differences between the planned and encountered drilling conditions led to fluid replacement during the operation. On the other hand, in the second well, 2.000 m salt extension was successfully drilled to depth with no major operational problems and good drilling performance. The field application of WBM proved to be a good option to drill the salt layers in the development of Pre-Salt fields but it demands a more detailed knowledge of both lithology and stratigraphy of the evaporite section.

This paper makes use of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for studying the water mass distribution and circulation variability in the SBCS during the year of 2012. Model outputs were compared to in situ, historical observations and to satellite data. The model was able to reproduce the main thermohaline characteristics of the waters dominating the SBCS and the adjacent region. The mixing between the Subantarctic Shelf Water and the Subtropical Shelf Water, known as the Subtropical Shelf Front (STSF), presented a clear seasonal change in volume. As a consequence of the mixing and of the seasonal oscillation of the STSF position, the stability of the water column inside the SBCS also changes seasonally. Current velocities and associated transports estimated for the Brazil Current (BC) and for the Brazilian Coastal Current (BCC) agree with previous measurements and estimates, stressing the fact that the opposite flow of the BCC occurring during winter in the study region is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the BC.

Therefore, to guarantee the safety of their operations, the O&G companies are being pushed by regulators agencies to establish a robust and efficient safety management system, particularly in Brazil, where the Petroleum National Agency published, in 2015, the SGSS (Technical Regulation of the Subsea Systems Operational Safety Management System). The new regulation forced Brazilian Operators, such as Petrobras, to promote a couple of initiatives, in order to increase the safety of their offshore operations. One of these initiatives has its focus into eliminate or minimize the risks in operational phase, maximizing the potential to avoid them during engineering design phase, where the ability to influence safety is higher than another project phase. One of the challenges of this approach is related to the fact that, in general, and regarding operational safety, the engineering design works in a passive way, in other words, the safety improvements in the new projects only are applied if a strong operational safety issues feedback process is established. Operators have been noted that this operational feedback to design engineers is not the only way to achieve a high level of safety in their operations and facilities. There is a consensus that the engineering design shall work in an active way, being more predictive than corrective, in order to avoid operational issues.

"85085773825","Fatigue is one of the key governing conditions in the design of rigid risers, in particular those in ultra-deep water. One effective way of improving fatigue is to adopt a lazy wave configuration, rather than a simple catenary. Steel Lazy Wave Risers (SLWR) have been successfully used offshore Brazil (Hoffman et al. 2010, Oliveira et al. 2017) and in the Gulf of Mexico (Beattie et al. 2013), and have been considered for the North Sea (Felista et al. 2015) and offshore Australia (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2015). Yet, it is probably the most computational-intensive aspect of it. Fatigue analyses require a very large number of load cases to be run, on complex, non-linear models. Methods for simplifying aspects of the analysis are highly desirable, but they must be weighed to provide the required safety levels whilst not introducing uneconomical, overconservative assumptions. The top first weld is a crucial hotspot, in particular for production SLWRs (Senra et al. 2011). These typically adopt flexible joints (FJ) at the connection to the vessel/platform, and linearization of the FJ stiffness is one of these key simplifications that bring significant value in reducing analysis cost. This paper describes a method for estimating the characteristic angle used for the linearization, which results in significant stiffness reduction in contrast with the usual, simpler method. Non-linear FJ stiffness curves are usually available, and they provide stiffness associated to the FJ absolute angle. The FJ stiffness significantly reduces with the angle of rotation. The conventional method adopts the stiffness corresponding to the most likely riser angle - absolute value measured from the static configuration. Conversely, the proposed methodology for estimating the most likely change in angle. As the angles often turn up in alternate angles, the proposed method results in much higher characteristic angle, and hence much lower FJ stiffness. The outcome is significantly less conservative designs, whilst still meeting the same required safety margins. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Flexible joint stiffness modelling improving ultra deep water rigid risers fatigue damage","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"85053593980","This study aims to characterize the physical vulnerability of the western coast of Santa Catarina Island by applying the Smartline methodology. Erosion and flooding processes can endanger the installed human infrastructure in the coastal zone, with the degree of vulnerability of a given site being dependent on its natural characteristics, or even due to changes induced by human action. The methodology applied in this research adopts a multiscale approach and considers, using coastline segmentation, the specificities of the analyzed coastal sectors. Each identified segment receives a classification regarding its physical vulnerability, resulting from the integration of several attributes, which must be selected according to the coastal hazard that one wishes to represent. In the analysis, three distinct levels of physical support and behavior of the coastal processes are considered. The first-order attributes are structural, and their characteristics are broad; the second-order ones are transitional between structural and dynamic and, the third-order attributes are dynamic, with specific characteristics. The methodology was applied on the west coast of Santa Catarina Island, a sector sheltered from oceanic waves, characterizing a low energy environment. Eight descriptors were selected for erosion and coastal flooding, these being: “geology” having two classes, distributed along 12 segments and “geomorphology”, three classes in eight segments, both of which were considered first-order variables. “Average astronomical tide current speed” (five classes in 15 segments), “average backshore height” (four classes in 20 segments), and “degree of exposure to wind waves” (five classes in 28 segments) compose the second order, while “backshore features” (seven classes in 28 segments), “grain size” (five classes in 26 segments) and “beach face slope” (three classes in 30 segments) describe third-order processes. By the integration of first-order attributes an Indicative Map of Vulnerability to Erosion and Flooding was generated, which classified the coast into “very Low”, “low”, “moderate”, and “high” vulnerability classes. As a final result of the analytical process the coastline, first-, second-, and third-order attributes were mathematically integrated by means of spatial analysis techniques, with the studied coastline represented as a segmented line according to the different classes of attributed physical vulnerability, highlighting the sectors with the most propensity to erosion and flooding. This Map of Physical Vulnerability to Erosion and Flood indicated that the west coast of Santa Catarina Island can be divided into sectors of low and moderate vulnerability in similar proportions, with occasional occurrences of high vulnerability in specific sectors. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Assessment of the physical vulnerability to erosion and flooding in a sheltered coastal sector: Florianópolis Bay, Brazil","Springer Netherlands",True,"2019"
"79952620223","The dynamic of gravity-driven turbidity currents is strongly influenced by the morphology of the seafloor, formed by topographic highs and lows on the margin along the depositional profile. This paper focuses on the methodology and the main results of a study on the palaeotopographic controls in a turbidite succession, with an application in an oilfield of the Brazilian offshore Campos Basin. This basin is located in the Brazilian passive margin, on which tectonics is partly controlled by halokinesis; the selected reservoirs are confined Turonian to Campanian siliciclastic turbidite systems. Six seismic-lithologic horizons of regional extension were mapped, from the Aptian salt to the Miocene as well as related faults. Four main reservoir-scale units were identified, stratigraphically comprised between two of the regional horizons, and their related surfaces were mapped. The complete ensemble of horizons and faults was used to build a multi-2D geological model. Individual surface restorations performed in every horizon allowed the structural coherence and the unfolding-unfaulting quality to be evaluated. Multi-surface restorations were then carried out in order to determine the related horizon palaeotopography of each reference depositional time. The results of the geological modeling and of the structural restorations indicate that the halokinesis-related listric faults regulated the distribution of the basal reservoirs. Additionally, at the top of the Albian carbonates, a canyon was identified, which, in association with the tectonic structures form the palaeotopographic constraints for the upper reservoir geometry. This work sheds light on the importance of structural restoration in understanding the tectonic-sedimentation interactions and the palaeotopography to the distribution of the studied turbidite reservoirs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Impact of salt-related palaeotopography on the distribution of turbidite reservoirs: Evidence from well-seismic analyses and structural restorations in the Brazilian offshore",NULL,True,"2011"
"84951918487","Following the major pre-salt reservoirs discovery in Santos Basin by Petrobras in 2006, a large number of exploratory and development wells have been drilled in the area. More recently, some of those wells have been drilled in large wellbore configurations, mostly due to deeper pre-salt layers and geological uncertainties. This paper presents a case study on drilling a deep 16 1/2″ vertical section at a deepwater location, where a turbine and an impregnated bit were used because of an extremely tough drilling scenario. This specific run achieved TD at more than 5000m, marking the first record ever of successfully running an impregnated bit of this size offshore. The basic well design data is shown, as well as the drilling program and offset well and other 16 1/2″ bit records. The challenges that were found on drilling deep post-salt 16 1/2″ sections in other locations and on the previous BHA runs with PDC bits on this section are highlighted and analyzed with drilling parameters. The impregnated bit specifications and the turbine characteristics are outlined taking operational recommendations into account. Available power at the bit was taken into consideration and the concern with its impact on drilling performance is explained through a comparison with other bit diameters which are widely used. The bit records, drilling parameters and UCS analysis of the section made clear that the turbine with impregnated bit was the most appropriate and effective drilling system for the scenario at the end of the section. A drilling time and cost comparison with other deep hard-formation-16 1/2″ sections drilled in other locations shows that the use of this system may yield significant reduction in the total cost by shortening the overall rig time, making it the preferred option in some future challenging drilling projects. Lastly, further turbodrilling and impregnated bit improvements are suggested, theoretically analyzed and justified considering drilling performance maximization and drilling tools and rig equipment limitations.

"84905748711","In what is being called the first oil and gas sustainable commissioning project, composite abrasives are being used to help conserve precious resources. The core of this sustainable solution includes composite abrasives and an innovative Pipeline Inspection Gauge/Gadget (or pig) system, which were first field tested and then used in Petrobras Refinaria Abreu de Lima, also known as Refinaria do Nordeste (RNEST), in Brazil. This paper focuses on the commissioning of two atmospheric distillation units (ADUs) at RNEST; ADU 11 and ADU 12. During the commissioning process, residual products in pipelines are removed (1) to assure efficient flow though refinery systems and (2) to protect operating equipment. Traditional methods of pipeline cleaning during commissioning typically include cleaning with water, chemical cleaning or steam cleaning. Each of these methods use a high volume of water, produce a high volume of wastewater discharge to be treated, and some have inherent risks to commissioning personnel and/or the environment. Because no water was used during the composite abrasive blasting at RNEST, all water-related steps (e.g. conditioning, drying, special treatment, disposal and storage/disposal) were eliminated. Thus, the number of steps in the cleaning process dropped to four: (1) abrasive blasting pipe internals and (2) applying the appropriate treatment via pig, (3) hydrostatic testing and (4) water treatment/recycling. Using data from the RNEST sustainable commissioning process, this paper will compare common cleaning operations to the new sustasinable commisioning method. Results convey that sustainable commissioning at RNEST used 300,000 liters of reusable water per atmospheric distillation unit versus more than 30 million liters per unit that would have been used with tradtional methods. (This value is estimated based on the RNEST project). In addition to conserving water, sustainable commissioning at RNEST also significantly reduced the time and monetary impact of the commissioning process. The positive environmental and economic results of sustainable commissioning can carry over to similar offshore applications during the commissioning and maintenance of internal piping systems.

"84883765292","Given the importance of copepods in pelagic food webs, short- and medium-scale temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of copepods of the genus Pseudodiaptomus was investigated in an oligo-mesohaline estuary (Paracauari) in northern Brazil. This system is characterized by high local hydrodynamics and nutrient input from the Paracauari River and Marajó Bay, and marked seasonal variation in rainfall levels. The temporal variation in the abundance of copepods was analyzed in the context of some hydrological variablestide height, salinity, temperature, pH, and concentrations of suspended particulate material, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a. Samples were collected in 2009 at a fixed station (00°44′15.4″S, 48°31′07.5″W) every 3 hours during a nycthemeral cycle in the neap and spring tides of February, May, June, August, November, and December. Zooplankton samples were collected using horizontal hauls of plankton nets with a 120 μm mesh. Following identification, the abundance and density of Pseudodiaptomus copepods were determined. Data were analyzed using an ANOVA (to assess the significance of diurnal, fortnightly and seasonal variations), PCA, and Bray-Curtis similarity. Four species were identified: Pseudodiaptomus richardi, Pseudodiaptomus marshi, Pseudodiaptomus gracilis, and Pseudodiaptomus acutus. The results indicate that variation in composition and density of the Pseudodiaptomidae copepods in the Paracauari estuary is determined by the interactive effect of the freshwater influx from Marajó Bay, tides, and the rainfall regimen, which modulate local salinity. The absence of diurnal variation in species composition and density was determined by the high local hydrodynamics, which provoke the constant mixing of the estuary's water. © Coastal Education & Research Foundation 2013.","Short and medium-term changes of Pseudodiaptomidae copepods in the Amazonian Mangrove Coast: The Paracauari River estuary (Brazil)",NULL,True,"2013"

Our aim was to verify if adjacent nursery areas with different environmental condition (Sepetiba and Guanabara bays, SE Brazil) influence on shrimp populations (eg, CPUE) and body shapes. Samplings were carried out during 12 months in those bays ca. 85 Km far from each other. Carapace length (CL), total body length (TL), wet weight, abdomen size and TL/CL ratio were used to analyze variations in shape through regressions. In general, F. brasiliensis was 4 to 6 times more abundant than F. paulensis. The sex ratio differed from 1:1 in F. brasiliensis in both bays, with dominance of females, largest catches occur in autumn. However, differences in size and morphology were found between bays, mainly regarding the TL/CL ratio. Shrimps in Sepetiba Bay have higher TL/CL showing a more “elongated shape” (larger abdomen) when compared to those from Guanabara Bay. Results suggest the existence of an estuary vs shrimp morphology relationship which results in differences in body shape even in spatially close areas. TL/CL ratio has proven useful for assessing shrimp populations differences and might be tested for tracking the origin of adult shrimps stocks at the coast. © 2019, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

"85086245971","Piezocone Penetration Test (CPTu) is widely used in offshore projects to obtain soil parameters, suchas the undrained shear strength. Due to depth limitations to perform this test, it is common to obtaindata until around 40m when the conductor installation process would require at least double the depth.The present work uses extrapolation techniques based on analytic and heuristic approaches to estimatedata beyond the depth domain of CPTu tests. Design of the conductor casing is highly dependent onsoil properties, since it serves as a foundation element of the well. Estimation of the soil parameters isbased on deepwater CPTu data from Brazilian offshore basins. Three analytical approaches are used in thisstudy (linear and non-linear regressions: Second and third degrees). Moreover, Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) (dense, convolutional and recurrent networks) are also employed to predict the soil behavior.Methodologies were applied, validated and compared to evaluate their capability to accurately estimatethe undrained shear strength. Python subroutines were developed and applied to sets of homogeneous andheterogeneous data from CPTu tests. The undrained shear strength was estimated beyond the test domainuntil the depth of interest to the conductor casing design around 80m. For this purpose, both groups oftechniques were validated analyzing the efficiency of the fitting process, the associated error and coefficientof determination of each methodology. From that point on, we compared data from analytical methodsand the neural networks application, verifying which technique fits better on the datasets. These methodsof estimation of soil properties work as an instrument to support the decision-making process in top-holedrilling operations. The datasets analyzed present different levels of soil heterogeneity and performing theextrapolation analysis brings additive information to understand the soil behavior beyond depths reachedby CPTu tests.

"84975761253","This work reports the chemical monitoring of saline water and sediments at Aratu port, All Saints Bay, Brazil, when subjected to a deep dragging process (DDP) over a 2-year period (2010–2012). The aim of this work was to detect which metals had possible deleterious effects on the biota. It analyzed percentage of silt + clay and TOC and metal concentrations (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn) before, during, and after the DDP. The determination of metal concentration in sediments used the following techniques: atomic absorption spectrometer with flame, also with hydrate generation, and cold vapor spectrophotometry. The DDP disturbed the concentrations of metals in sediments and water, but 15 months after the DDP, only Cu and Zn were detectable on the bottom saline water, and 20 months after the DDP, only Zn was detectable in water. This fact indicates that these metals were longer available for absorption by the marine biota with probable deleterious effect. Indeed, studies by others during the DDP in Aratu port, indicated the decrease from 50 to 40 of the number of microalgae species identified. On the other hand, in the sediments, 20 months after the DDP, the concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Hg, returned to the original values, but Ni and Zn did not return to their original values. Comparison with studies by others indicated that the sediments from dredging were inappropriate for disposal at sea. This work indicated that the metals Cu, Ni, and Zn are the most deleterious elements to the marine environment. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Effects of dredging at Aratu port in All Saints Bay, Brazil: monitoring the metal content in water and sediments","Springer International Publishing",True,"2016"

Today, the identification of coastal vulnerabilities worldwide is necessary to prevent impacts and drive action. The aim of the work was to estimate the vulnerable areas from a total rate of increase in sea level of 2.8 m and to identify the impacts of greater magnitude through the use of hierarchical analysis. The analytic hierarchy process method was used to list the most serious impacts. In addition, the simulation of the most vulnerable sites was carried out in a GIS environment using geoprocessing and a digital terrain model for the area of study. The Ilha Grande Bay region (southeastern Brazil) was chosen as a test area due to its economic, tourist and environmental importance. The main impacts are floods, coastal erosion and loss of coastal ecosystems. The most vulnerable areas are characterized as flat with low slopes, usually coastal plains occupied by environmental protection areas, urban centers and historical centers.

In northern Rio de Janeiro and southern Espírito Santo states, the Barreiras Formation preserve alluvial depositional system. The sediments were derived from a source located in the hinterland of the southeastern Brazilian continental margin, where rocks formed or reworked notably during the Gondwana supercontinent assembly are exposed. Detrital zircon U–Pb ages are mostly late Neoproterozoic, dominantly close to 608 Ma. Source rocks of this age occurred within the Ribeira and Araçuaí belts and were formed during their main magmatic activity. U–Pb zircon age distribution is similar to the southern and central Ribeira belt. Zircon fission-track ages occur in four main groups, between 429 and 358 Ma, 351 and 274 Ma, 270 and 171 Ma, and 167 and 127 Ma. Complex variation in the detrital zircon fission-track ages is related to the continental crust thermal evolution in the source areas. Older ages also occur between 534 and 433 Ma (Cambrian-to-Silurian periods) and are chrono-correlated to post-orogenic processes after the Gondwana supercontinent agglutination. Zircon fission-track ages between 429 and 274 Ma (Silurian to Permian periods) are related to the formation of the Pangea supercontinent, whereas the predominant zircon fission-track age group, between 270 and 171 Ma (Permian to Jurassic periods), is chrono-correlated to both orogeneses in the Gondwana supercontinent west margin and the Pangea supercontinent breakup. Zircon fission-track ages from 167 to 127 Ma are in the same period as the opening of the North and South Atlantic oceans.

"70449650835","In a scenario of huge investments in the quest for new oil and natural gas discoveries, the oil industry has reached a consensus: no easy fields to be developed remain undiscovered, especially in offshore environments. New and old challenges on well drilling such as drilled extensions over 6000 m, sub-salt drilling, very narrow operational windows, operational problems like lost of circulation, stuck pipe, and kicks are aggravated when drilling in high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) environments. In the world's exploratory context, the occurrence of HPHT areas is an increasing trend. It is the materialization of the worst case scenario for well drilling and safety, formed by great challenges and operational, environmental, and economic risks. Field experience has shown that the economical risks have been overshadowed by the great premium target: increments on reserves. However, if the well safety aspect is dealt with the conventional approach, the oil industry is at risk of losing its investments, causing great impacts to the environment and also to the company's image. Since HPHT well construction costs are so much higher than those of traditional wells, the scope of knowledge and science on well safety, once limited to kick prevention and well control contingencies, are now an integral part of the technical and economic feasibility of well construction.

"84864615590","The Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster (SBPSC), Offshore Southeast Brazil, is a unique scenario, posing great development challenges. The microbial carbonate reservoir is unusual regarding its origin and petrophysical properties; the fluids have a variable CO2 content; the few analogue reservoirs around the world do not compare in terms of volumes, water depth and distance to the coast; and there are also flow assurance issues. Considering the importance of these reserves for the Brazilian economy and the opportunity to accelerate cash flow, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a fast track development, including extended well tests (EWTs) and production pilots.

These numbers refer only to Petrobras share and do not include me transfer of rights with economic compensation from the Brazilian government to Petrobras. Therefore, the initial development phase will have to cope with several uncertainties, mainly the subsurface ones. Some of the most relevant are the quality and the heterogeneity degree of each reservoir zone; the compositional grading of the fluids; the performance of different EOR methods; and the presence of fractures affecting the flow. How to specify and anticipate the acquisition of expensive equipment, such as FPSOs and subsea devices, with uncertainties to be clarified? When is it worth to invest in more data acquisition, such as EWTs, core and fluid sampling, extensive lab analysis or even more appraisal wells? The timing and the uncertainty reduction foreseen for each initiative must be taken into account.

This Buoy Supporting Risers (BSR) system concept presents several advantages to overcome the challenges of installing SCRs on ultra-deep waters, such as, allowing decoupling between installation of risers and the production unit, reducing payload on the unit, reduced risks associated with clashes and very small dynamics transmitted from production unit to the risers, resulting in significant less fatigue issues. Due to sour and C02 service requirements for the production and water injection risers, it was decided to use mechanically lined pipe for the entire line, with the exception of the top and touch down sections, where metallurgical clad (metclad) pipe was used. Consequently, a significant amount of qualification, testing and inspection associated to welding lined and metclad pipes was required. In order to install Corrosion Resistant Alloys (CRA) lined pipes with a Reel-Lay vessel, a novel methodology for water pressurized spooling and pipelay was developed to mitigate the risk of liner damage during installation. Full-scale pressurized spooling trials were done ahead of the pipelay campaign for testing and validation of this methodology. In addition, analyses were performed to evaluate the BSR system behaviour during SCRs installation and to minimize buoy de-ballasting interventions.

One of the challenges set by the oil companies has been to reduce the unit costs of OBS data - ""If only the square kilometer rates were lower we would shoot more data"" is a common mantra. The difficulty in doing this has been the inherent technical downtime experienced by all the contractors operating ocean bottom systems - the terminations, connectors, power distribution and data telemetry components within a traditional ocean bottom cable (OBC) system are inherently prone to failure due to the intrinsic nature of the cable deployment/recovery cycle where the cables are stressed and de-stressed every time they are laid onto/recovered from the seabed.

"85013858173","We present new evidence for the existence of a large pockmark field on the continental slope of the Santos Basin, offshore southeast Brazil. A recent high-resolution multibeam bathymetric survey revealed 984 pockmarks across a smooth seabed at water depths of 300–700 m. Four patterns of pockmark arrays were identified in the data: linear, network, concentric, and radial. Interpretation of Two-dimensional multi-channel seismic reflection profiles that crosscut the surveyed area shows numerous salt diapirs in various stages of development (e.g. salt domes, walls, and anticlines). Some diapirs were exposed on the seafloor, whereas the tops of others (diapir heads) were situated several hundreds of meters below the surface. Extensional faults typically cap these diapirs and reach shallow depths beneath the seafloor. Our analysis suggests that these pockmark patterns are linked to stages in the development of underlying diapirs and their related faults. The latter may extend above salt walls, take the form of polygonal extensional faults along higher-level salt anticlines, or concentric faults above diapir heads that reach close to the seafloor. Seismic data also revealed buried pockmark fields that had repeatedly developed since the Middle Miocene. The close spatio-temporal connection between pockmark and diapir distribution identified here suggests that the pockmark field extends further across the Campos and Espírito Santo Basins, offshore Brazil. Spatial overlap between the pockmark field topping a large diapir field and a proliferous hydrocarbon basin is believed to have facilitated the escape of fluid/gas from the subsurface to the water column, which was enhanced by halokinesis. This provides a possible control on fossil gas contribution to the marine system over geological time. © 2017 The Authors","An extensive pockmark field on the upper Atlantic margin of Southeast Brazil: spatial analysis and its relationship with salt diapirism","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2017"
"85020183362","We discuss a depth imaging solution that uses primaries and all orders of multiple reflections to image seismic data from seabed acquisitions. The processing sequence starts by separating the up-going (P-UP) and down-going (P-DWN) wavefields from the seabed hydrophone and geophone measurements. The data are then organized into receiver gathers and the P-UP and P-DWN wavefields are migrated independently. By using the primaries and all orders of multiples in the migration, we greatly improve the resolution of the image and significantly expand the areal illumination of the survey. The improvements are not limited to the stack image; our imaging solution produces finely sampled angle gathers that could be further utilized for velocity model building or image enhancement post migration. We present a successful application of the technology to an Ocean Bottom Cable (OBC) recording system deployed for the Petrobras Permanent Reservoir Monitoring (PRM) pilot over the Jubarte field in the Campos basin offshore Brazil.","Separated wavefield imaging of Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS) data","European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, EAGE",True,"2015"

We categorized the governance instruments of MERs into (i) instruments for land/sea tenure and beneficiaries’ recognition, (ii) territorial use planning, (iii) institutional arenas for discussion and deliberation, as well as (iv) public policies. Although the legal arrangements of these protected areas address fundamental dimensions of governance, we present the challenges of its implementation based on the voice of local managers. The managers are the bridge between the central government and communities, dealing with the implementation of the institutional framework in a reality of multi-level and multi-scale drama: from local to national dilemmas, from organizational to structural ones.

"85041277142","This chapter presents advances in studies related to the monitoring and development of biotechnologies for the restoration of mangrove areas in Todos os Santos Bay that have been impacted by petroleum. The results of surface sediment monitoring show that the estuary of the São Paulo River has the most pollution from petroleum-derived hydrocarbons. Our biostimulation and bioaugmentation tests indicated that in relation to a control (natural attenuation), biodegradation was more rapid when using either of these techniques. The results showed greater degradation of the saturated hydrocarbons in the units receiving a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizer blend, indicating the better biostimulation efficacy of this fertilizer. The bioaugmentation experiment indicates that the consortiums showed promise for use in bioremediation: they increased the degradation by approximately 30%. Greater efficacy in removing organic compounds from sediments was observed in two phytoremediation models (approximately 89% removal). The three models were effective in the removal of fraction 3A (C16-23), but the two phytoremediation models achieved much greater degradation of fractions 3B (C23-34) and 4 (C34-40). The data indicate that the two phytoremediation models were more effective than the intrinsic bioremediation model in the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"85030842598","Decommissioning and abandonment of Brazilian offshore oil & gas fields has become more important in the last few years due to the maturing hydrocarbon producing basin in the region. However, a complete abandonment of a Brazilian offshore field has not been completed to date and the consequent lack of a reference case leads to uncertainties with operators and stakeholders during the conceptual phases of abandonment, when identifying the best decommissioning option and estimating a reasonable cost for the complete program of decommissioning activities. This paper aims to satisfy this uncertainty and develop a Brazilian baseline for front end planning and cost estimation of the decommissioning, removal and disposal options. The methodology presented in this paper is based on analysis of the national and international regulations applicable to decommissioning, the expectation of stakeholders and national supply chain benchmarking. Drawing on the conclusions of this analysis, the paper then presents the available decommissioning options generally applicable for fixed platform, floating platforms, pipelines and subsea facilities. The eligibility of each decommissioning option is then investigated against the background of current Brazilian regulatory requirement, highlighting those cases where the options are not mentioned in the legislation or where contradictions exist. Further analysis of the options is then undertaken to determine the preferred solution from the stakeholder perspective and to also define national supply chain benchmarking of the options to confirm whether the national supply chain can support the future potential demand for decommissioning in Brazil. Finally, the paper shows a comparative case study for the high-level planning and cost estimation for the decommissioning of a complex of small fixed platforms including the plugging and abandonment (P&A) of the platform wells. ©2017, Offshore Technology Conference.","Baseline for planning & cost estimation of Brazilian decommissioning","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2017"
"85074489503","The Santa Catarina Plateau is a prominent undersea feature of the Brazilian Southern Margin with approximately 340,000 km2 that interrupts the lower continental slope between depths of 2900 and 3200 m. The plateau’s morphology and basement were unknown until new geophysical data were acquired for the Brazilian Continental Shelf Survey Program (LEPLAC). The multibeam bathymetry, sub-bottom profile, and mini-airgun data allowed the identification of important morphologic features, such as the Santa Catarina Drift and Pelotas Drift, and the study of their sedimentary processes, especially related to slope instabilities and mass movement. The seismic and gravimetric datase.ts allowed the study of the Torres High, an important structural feature that supports most of the Santa Catarina Plateau. With this new dataset, it was possible to develop different gravimetric models, controlled by the ultra-deep seismic information, to analyze the two competing hypotheses for the nature of Torres High: (1) thickened oceanic crust or (2) continental crust. The crustal and the Moho character below the Torres High, observed in strike- and dip-oriented ultra-deep seismic lines, and the results of the gravimetric model, support the interpretation of its continental nature. Additionally, the analysis of the basement depth and the interpretation of the Bouguer gravity map clearly show the Torres High as a continuous structural feature attached to the South American continent, in a northwest-southeast direction, constituting a continental promontory of the Brazilian land mass and part of the basement of the Santa Catarina Plateau. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","The Santa Catarina Plateau and the nature of its basement","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",True,"2020"
"85079784581","We applied a combined approach of benthic terrain modelling with sediment type distribution, using regional available data sets in order to map the distribution of seabed physical habitats along the Espírito Santo Continental Shelf, Brazil. The Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) was used to define benthic terrain classes, which were combined with ground truth data (sediment samples and seabed images) to produce physical habitats (seascapes). Eight BTM classes were defined: flat bottom, rough, depression, valley flank, valley bottom, shelf break, crests, and deep crests. The combination of the BTM classes with sediment distribution produced 17 types of physical habitats. Analysis showed that shelf morphology controls the pattern of habitat distribution, combined with two major sedimentary processes: riverine sediment input and carbonate sedimentation. Seven types of physical habitats area associated with the flat bottom morphometric class, and five types of physical habitats are associated with rough/irregular morphometric classes. These are the two main broad categories observed along the shelf, when combined with the presence of rhodoliths. Shelf-incised valleys, combined with rhodolith beds, are the most conspicuous seascape along the ESCS. These seascapes add slope and roughness to the shelf seabed, producing great morphological complexity and potentially supporting diverse benthic communities. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","The use of Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM) in the characterization of continental shelf habitats","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",True,"2020"
"84856741449",":With the application of new technologies for processing and interpreting seismic data, PETROBRAS, in recent years, has achieved great success in the discovery of giant oil fields underlying thick layers of rock salt. Due to the mechanical behavior of these rocks, subject to the creep phenomenon, it was developed a large research and development project in order to determine the creep properties of these rocks and the application of computational simulations to predict the behavior of deep wells during the drilling of these layers. If on one hand the salt layers, with thicknesses ranging from 2000m to 5000 m, are a challenge in drilling activity, they can be considered in the logistic flow of gas and final destination of CO 2. The rock salt has negligible porosity when compared to other geomaterials, which guarantees excellent impermeability to most fluids and gases, even under high pressures. Another phenomenon associated with rock salt is the process of self-healing. Taking advantage of these physical-chemical and structural properties of rock salt, caverns opened by dissolution in salt domes have been used for storage of hydrocarbons and other products. Considering the large regional thicknesses and continuity of rock salt overlying the presalt reservoirs, PETROBRAS is studying the strategy and technical and economic feasibility for the use of underground storage of natural gas and CO 2 in salt caverns.

These systems are designed to operate efficiently and economically when producing ∼ 500 bpd. UK-based company CompactGTL plc and Velocys are developing modular solutions that combine steam methane reforming (SMR) and Fischer Tropsch (FT), and both have found ways to reduce the size of the hardware. In the integrated two-stage system developed by CompactGTL, which is designed to incorporate modules weighing < 25 ton and producing 200 bpd of liquids per module, the SMR and FT reactions are carried out in a series of mini-channels. In contrast, the Velocys combined SMR/FT system for offshore GTL takes advantage of microchannel reactor technology to shrink the hardware and intensify the processes even further. Both the CompactGTL and Velocys technologies have reached the trial stage. CompactGTL entered into a joint development testing agreement in 2006 with Petrobras to deliver a 20 bpd pilot plant to be tested onshore at the Petrobras Aracaju site in Brazil. While, in March 2010, Velocys entered into a joint demonstration and testing agreement with offshore facility developer Modec, Toyo Engineering, and Petrobras, to build and operate a 5-10 bpd microchannel GTL demonstration plant at the Petrobras facility in Fortaleza, Brazil.

"85055263465","One late Quaternary sediment core from the continental slope of the northern sector of Pelotas Basin (southern Brazilian continental margin, 2091 m water depth) was analyzed in order to evaluate the influence of the organic matter influx in the benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition on a regional scale. This study investigated the relationship between epifaunal species (Epistominella exigua and Alabaminella weddellensis) and infaunal species (Uvigerina peregrina and Angulogerina angulosa) integrated in a relative abundance based index, the “Organic Input Index” (OrgIn). The correlation of these species with abiotic data is also discussed, including mud content, total organic carbon (TOC) and carbon stable isotope (δ13C) in Uvigerina peregrina. The age model based on one radiocarbon dating of planktonic foraminifera and oxygen isotope composition of benthic foraminifera (Uvigerina) revealed the record spans the last 112,500 yr, covering the Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5 to 3. The dominance of infaunal species, mainly Globocassidulina subglobosa, boliviniids and buliminiids throughout the entire core is interpreted as an indicator of an increase of organic matter supply and dominance of the eutrophic conditions in this study area. The variations found in the proportion of the epifaunal and infaunal species indicate distinctive inputs of organic matter (phytodetritus input versus bacterial activity, respectively). An increasing trend in the importance of epifaunal species from the base of the core to uppermost samples (MIS 5 to MIS 3) was also observed, which is assumed to be evidence of the higher productivity of the surface water masses in this sector of the South Atlantic during the glacial periods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Infaunal and epifaunal benthic foraminifera species as proxies of organic matter paleofluxes in the Pelotas Basin, south-western Atlantic Ocean","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2018"
"85097876795","This study aims to provide an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) perspective of the production and distribution of alternative marine fuels in Brazilian ports, considering the International Maritime Organization (IMO) emission reduction target for 2050 (IMO2050). Although other mitigation measures are available, it is likely that alternative fuels will be required, implying additional costs and entailing relevant impacts on other energy chains and land use. Hence, the national IAM BLUES model is adapted to represent the relevant part of the international shipping sector. A set of scenarios is developed considering different fuel alternatives, demand assumptions and national mitigation targets. Findings show that taking into account emissions of CO2 only or of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) within the IMO strategy significantly impacts the optimal technological portfolio. Furthermore, achieving the IMO2050 goal without considering a national decarbonization strategy may result in potential spillovers. The intense use of the energy sector could partially compromise the gains obtained by maritime decarbonization or even surpass it.

"85061179665","The Atlantic Ocean coast region of southeast Brazil contains two coast-parallel mountain ranges (the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira) generated by tectonic activity pulses tens of millions years after the main continental rift event occurred around 120 Ma. Although the short-term erosion rates for the region are established, the relative importance of the factors controlling erosion is poorly constrained. We combine new and published catchment-averaged erosion rates (n = 48) using in situ-produced 10 Be concentrations in quartz from river sediments to establish the regional erosion pattern. The river catchments are (i) escarpment topography, (ii) high-altitude low-relief and (iii) mixed topography, which record how escarpment fronts are migrating inland. Ocean-facing coastal escarpment catchments of the Serra do Mar (ε = 18–53 m/Ma) can be eroded approximately twice as fast as continent-facing escarpment catchments in the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira (ε = 7–24 m/Ma). The correlation between the normalized channel steepness index (k sn ) and slope angle indicates that river incision and hillslope erosion processes combine to maintain the high relief. The Serra do Mar catchments define a mean slope angle threshold indicating that landslides are the dominant erosional process when slope angles in excess of ~30°. Tectonic activity is low and plays no significant role in driving erosion. A first-order relationship between erosion rate and precipitation-temperature across the region implies that climate plays a key role in soil production, river incision and in triggering erosional processes. Although the high topographic relief is a pre-condition for the occurrence of significant erosion, the climatic condition is the outlining factor of the regional variation in erosion rates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Controls on the erosion of the continental margin of southeast Brazil from cosmogenic 10 Be in river sediments","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"
"85090509939","The use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) logs for petrophysical interpretation and evaluation in the oil and gas industry has increased in recent decades, especially in Brazil, where the use of this technology was increased by more than 400% from 2011 to 2018 (from 49 to 208 runs). This increased usaged occurred mainly because the porosity estimation provided by this technology is independent of lithology. Additionally, the porosity can be associated with different pore sizes. It can also be divided to quantify the fraction of porosity for the clay bound water, bound fluid by capillary forces and movable fluid by applying cutoff times in the spectrum of T2 distribution. Nevertheless, the presence of heavy oil in the Peregrino reservoir, with oil viscosities ranging varying from 150 to 350 cP, complicates NMR interpretation because the signal from the oil decays with a time constant that is comparable with that of capillary or clay-bound water, affecting the determination of permeability and the fluid distribution. This paper presents the results of applying innovative Gamma Inversion to process the logging-while-drilling (LWD) NMR data acquired in a well from the Peregrino Field, offshore Brazil. The Gamma Inversion process uses probabilistic functions, instead of exponential ones, to generate a T2 spectrum that is more consistent from a mathematical and geological point of view.

However, under certain economical and technical circumstances, marginal oilfields may be transferred to be conventional ones. Since Petrobras developed the first ever offshore deep reservoir (Lula) by scale in 2006, Brazil has been conducting a progressive campaign targeting hydrocarbons buried under deep water, which contributes to discovery of Lula, Carioca, Jupiter, Buzios, Libra and other giant presalt reservoirs in Santos Basin. CNPC signed a cooperation contract with Petrobras in 2013, taking 10% of the total shares. How to efficiently develop the oilfield has been a challenging issue. Technologies of smart water injection in Shengli Oilfield have been studied, while the field development and environment (deep water) of Libra Oilfield have been analyzed, in order that the smart water injection technologies may be modified to develop the marginal oilfield more efficiently. Different from conventional zonal water injection technologies, the remote wireless control water injection technologies take advantages of packers that are connected with each other via preset cables, which achieves downhole testing and water injection simultaneously. Being run via tubing, the water injection string locates a nozzle for each reservoir that is isolated by a packer. All nozzles are connected with packers via the preset cables that work as power lines for the whole string, so that downhole data such as pressures, flows and temperatures are all transferred to the processing computer on the surface. The computer program is used to convert pressure and formation signals into curves that are transferred to Company via WIFI or mobile 2G/3G/4G webs, in order that technicians there may understand and learn about downhole pressures, temperatures, flows and nozzle conditions in real time. They are able to open and close the nozzles totally or partially by giving orders that are transferred as signals via cables. In order to cope with offshore environment of Libra Oilfield in Santos Basin, pre-set cable packers have been modified accordingly, so that highly deviated wells may be developed with the smart water injection technologies.

The main purpose is to define characteristic corrosion rates for structural reassessment of the extension of life of FPSOs considering results of previous in-life inspections. The steel wear generates sectional loss and capacity reduction, possibly leading to structural failure. Being capable of estimating FPSO's plates and stiffeners thickness along the operational life would be a considerable safety improvement for the whole industry, benefiting operators and classifications societies.

The method is based on an adaptation of that proposed by IBAMA in Technical Note N°. 10/2012 (TN 10) used for assessment of environmental impacts required for the licensing of offshore activities in Brazil. By requirement of the Comparative Assessment methodology, there is a need for a numerical evaluation that allows comparing the performance of one alternative over the others. An analytical method was developed based on the combination of environmental attributes that contribute for the magnitude of the impacts (frequency, intensity, extension and duration) and sensitivity of the environmental factors affected (relevance, resilience and reversibility). The importance of the impacts is given by the combination of the environmental sensitivity with the magnitude of the impacts, in the called ""Environmental Impact Importance Score Matrix"". The proposed method provides a performance measure that allows comparing and prioritizing each decommissioning option according to the proposed criteria. It reduces the subjectivity in assessing the importance of the environmental impacts and provides greater transparency and traceability in the assessment of the impacts. As an example, the proposed method is applied for the decommissioning of a rigid pipeline between two platforms in Campos Basin, where the considered decommissioning options are: (a) complete removal by cut and lift and (b) leave in situ. For this particular case, the assessment of the proposed environmental sub-criteria revealed that Option (b) was the preferred option with respect to the impacts on marine and onshore environment. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","An analytical method to combine environmental attributes to generate the matrix of importance of environmental impacts for the decommissioning of subsea installations in Brazil","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"

In this study, we explore the postrift tectonic, geomorphic, magmatic, and sedimentary responses to stress changes using the Potiguar Basin, the easternmost basin in the equatorial margin of Brazil, as a case study. We use field and topographic data, 2D seismic reflection lines, vertical electric soundings, and geochronological and borehole data to constrain the stress evolution of the Potiguar Basin from the Late Cretaceous to the Quaternary, discussing the role of basin inversion on sedimentation and landforms. Our results indicate the presence of two strike-slip stress regimes after rifting. The first stress field (SF1) occurred from Late Cretaceous to the middle Miocene and consisted of a N-S-oriented maximum subhorizontal compression and an E-W-oriented extension. The second stress field (SF2) took place from the middle Miocene to the present day and included subhorizontal E-W to NW-SE compression combined with N-S and NE-SW subhorizontal extension. Emplacement of volcanic rocks occurred along transtensional faults, with a principal peak during SF1 at 20–30 Ma and a subordinate peak during SF2 at 5–10 Ma. In response to shortening during SF2, a 70-km-long and 50-km-wide dome formed, where marine Miocene strata were uplifted to ~250 m asl. This uplift induced the displacement of alluvial channels away from the dome. Anticlines formed by transpression along the main NE-SW-striking faults during both SF1 and ST2 acted as traps in the petroleum system. Similar shifts and stress field inversions documented in other areas of the Brazilian continental margin are consistent with the Neogene rise of the Andes and may have implications for reconstructing the tectonic history of the Equatorial Atlantic margin of South America. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Postrift stress field inversion in the Potiguar Basin, Brazil – Implications for petroleum systems and evolution of the equatorial margin of South America","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2020"
"85094168812","Invented by Petrobras in 1996, the torpedo anchor has been successfully applied in Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) in the Gulf of Mexico (Medeiros, 2002). With a torpedo-like hydrodynamic shape, the torpedo anchor obtains the kinetic energy required for penetration by free-falling through the water. It then uses that energy to penetrate into the seabed, thereby completing its installation. This paper discusses the large deformation finite element method and the CEL method, which are used to calculate the torpedo anchor penetration in a cohesive-soil seabed. The characteristics of the soil and the anchor at different moments during the torpedo anchor penetration are analyzed based on simulation results. © 2020 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc..

"84897470967","The Jandaíra Formation, a Turonian-Campanian carbonate platform in the Potiguar Basin, northeastern Brazil is the largest exposure of Phanerozoic carbonates in Brazil and presents well developed epigenic karst features, mostly of Quaternary age. In this work we used an integrated multidisciplinary approach in outcrops and core samples, which we combined Quickbird satellite imagery analysis, structural and sedimentary-facies mapping, and petrographic and petrophysical analyses. The studied area, in terms of facies, presents herein a variety, which includes mudstones to bioclastic, peloidal, intraclastic, and oolitic grainstones. Our results indicate that the main dissolution process occurred along N-S, NE-, and E-W-trending faults, which provided vertical leaching pathways of increased secondary porosity and permeability. In addition, dissolution mostly affected the dolomitized sedimentary facies in the form of vugular, moldic, interparticular, and intercrystalline porosity. Dissolution led to mechanical breakdown and collapse of carbonate blocks, which resulted in the infilling of clastic sediments and formation of collapse breccia in caves. It increased permeability in carbonate rocks from primary values of 0.0-0.94 mD to as much as 1370.11 mD. With the results obtained we conclude that karstified faults and fractures and preferential sedimentary facies form the karst system of the Jandaíra Formation, which makes the karst geometry predictable. We suggest that similar karst patterns may occur in paleokarst and fractured carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian offshore continental margin.

"85057883234","The experience gained by PETROBRAS over eleven years operating several floating production systems based on extensive use of flexible pipes, indicated that such a concept was a reliable alternative for deep water exploitation. To properly predict the behavior of flexible pipes in deeper water applications, more sophisticated analysis tools are naturally required. For such a reason, TUBFLEX, a P.C. program was recently developed in cooperation with the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. TUBFLEX takes into consideration two distinct mathematical models for pipes with either bonded or unbonded layers. Basically the input data consist in the following: mechanical characteristics of the layers (geometry and material properties), loading condition (internal and external pressure, tension, torsion, bending moment or imposed bending radius) and boundary conditions. Pipe global strains, ultimate stress conditions and pipe stiffness are typical output data. Both mathematical models are described and examples of practical applications are presented. Different concepts of pipe design are analyzed and output results are compared. Finally, some important points where PETROBRAS is making efforts to optimize the use of flexible pipes are presented.

"85056605922","In carbonate rock reservoirs, spatial distribution models and elastic properties are complex because of diagenetic processes and mineralogical composition, which together directly interfere with variations in pore shape and interconnectivity. The main objective of this paper is to propose a workflow to aid in three-dimensional quantitative carbonate reservoir characterization of the Quissamã Formation (Macaé Group) in the Pampo field of the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. Model-based seismic inversion, sequential Gaussian simulation with cokriging for porosity modeling, and truncated Gaussian simulation with trend for facies modeling were used to characterize the carbonate reservoirs. Our results show that the carbonate platform is located between the upper Aptian and lower Albian seismic surfaces. Interpretation of a new surface, called the intra-Albian, was possible via acoustic-impedance (AI) analysis. Our workflow facilitated identification of low AI, high porosity, and best facies areas in structural highs where the most productive wells have been drilled. Facies modeling suggests that intercalation of facies with high and low porosities is connected to shallowing-upward cycles. Finally, several debris facies with low AI and high porosities were identified in an area that could be targeted for new exploration. Copyright © 2018.

"84990861431","This study was conducted in the Itajaí-Açu river lower estuary in Southern Brazil, in which we aimed to: (1) analyze spatiotemporal variations on the macrofauna; (2) search for relationships between environmental variables and the assembly and (3) evaluate the influence of capital dredging upon the assembly. Two hundred twenty eight samples were performed in four stations, two of which affected by dredging. Sediment (sand, silt and clay, organic matter and carbonate) and water column´s variables (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity) were also assessed. We applied Principal Component Analysis for environmental variables and Hierarchical Clustering for biotic data. Correlations between environmental and biotic matrices were tested by Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates. Spatiotemporal variations in the assembly were tested by Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance. From the 21.839 organisms sampled, 97% was represented by the gastropod Heleobia australis. Despite the influence of the river discharge on the ecosystem, dredging was deleterious to the assembly, favoring opportunistic organisms such as H. australis. © 2016, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

"85068387773","Tender-assisted drilling (TAD) has been revealed as an efficient and effective solution in deep water installations to support drilling operations of tendon leg platforms (TLP). Although this concept is new in offshore Brazil, this has been used for more than 30 years not only in the Southeast Asia but also in the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa, and the North Sea. Due to the complex scenario of two floaters moored in close proximity, an extensive and careful hydrodynamic analysis is required to guarantee a successful execution. This work presents a numerical study of coupled wave motions on the TLP–TAD multibody system with the aim of investigating first-order loads, mean drift loads, and wave frequency responses using frequency and time domain approaches. Hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated by the 3D diffraction–radiation panel method; the mooring systems and the mechanical connection between the floaters were modeled through stiffness matrixes. In frequency domain analysis, several relative positions between the floaters were considered. On the other hand, in time domain studies, the finite element method (FEM) was used to represent moored systems and mechanical connections between the floaters. FEM allows the inclusion of drag forces, added mass, and interactions between mooring lines and floaters into the nonlinear dynamic simulations. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Naval.","Coupled wave motions on a tension leg platform and tender-assisted drilling","Springer",True,"2017"
"85085775396","Thermoplastic Composite Pipe (TCP) has a solid wall construction constituted from a single polymer material with embedded (melt-fused) fibre reinforcements. It is a disruptive technology where all the advantages for ultra-deep water developments come together: high strength, light weight, corrosion free, low CAPEX, etc. TCP is therefore one of the most promising solutions to overcome the recent failures found on pre-salt fields related to corrosion under high concentrations of H2S and CO2. However, introducing a new technology on very challenging applications such as deep water production risers, requires careful consideration and mitigation of all technical and project execution risks. This paper starts presenting a historical review of some of the new technologies applied offshore Brazil over the last 20 years making a parallel with the increasing acceptance of Thermoplastic Composite Pipe in the Brazilian market. Following the historical review, TCP technology is presented and strategy to enable free hanging catenary systems for ultra-deep water environments discussed. The basis of the study is a typical offshore Brazil pre-salt field and feasibility of 6"" and 8"" free hanging TCP risers were assessed. Study was performed in close cooperation with a major operator and an installation contractor in Brazil. Global, installation and local analyses of the TCP Riser system have shown the feasibility of installation as well as operations in a free hanging catenary configuration throughout the 30 years' service life. In 2017, this pre-FEED study was used as basis for a FMECA (Failure mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis). The FMECA exercise was carried out together with a third-party certification body and two major Oil &amp; Gas companies very active in Brazil. A detailed business case study was performed in order to quantify the potential CAPEX savings that TCP technology can bring compared to the low lazy wave systems currently installed in pre-salt fields, offshore Brazil. Result is that if TCP is adopted as primary technology for Risers&amp;Flowlines, significant savings are expected. Savings comes both from pipe and ancillary's procurement costs since TCP technology enables free hanging catenary configuration, avoiding purchase of expensive buoyancy modules. The outcome of this work lead to a qualification program currently being sponsored by one major operator active in Brazil. Technology Roadmap was established in phases being the ultimate goal the qualification of pre-salt 8.0in production lines. Reasons for adopting this qualification strategy is presented.

They are characterized by high amplitude discontinuous bodies, usually crosscutting stratigraphic layers, but can appear concordant to it. Extrusive volcanic rocks in 3D seismic data are characterized by high amplitude parallel layers showing a fan-like geometry.

"85097951230","The composition of estuarine fish fauna is dynamic and complex. Despite the variation in fish fauna in estuaries, it is possible to observe some species associated with microhabitats. The assemblage composition of these communities is apparently derived from habitat selection. The aim of this study was to assess the structure of the demersal fish fauna of the Paranaguá Bay and its relationship with biotic and abiotic factors. To this end, monthly collections were conducted using an otter trawl, from October 1999 to September 2000, at five sites in the shallow infralittoral. Biotic (organic matter, and invertebrates) and abiotic factors (salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, seston, and nutrients) were recorded during sampling. A total of 6,623 individuals were captured, belonging to 2 species of Chondrichthyes and 53 species of Actinopterygii (26 families). Sciaenidae was the most representative in terms of richness, with 11 species, and Ariidae was the most representative in terms of abundance. The catfish Cathorops spixii was the most abundant species, representing 21 % of the entire catch. There were significant differences in the composition and abundance of the fish fauna among the studied areas, as evidenced by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Such differences seem to be related to the complexity of habitats, which occur due to different types of bottom cover found at each sampling site. The abiotic variables indicated little influence on the structure of the fish assembly. These results contribute to a better understanding of the fish fauna from the shallow infralittoral areas of the Paranaguá Bay, and provide data to decision makers for better implementation of management and conservation measures. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

"85026803842","Santos Basin Pre-Salt Cluster, Deepwater Southeast Brazil, is a unique scenario due to the heterogeneous nature of its microbial carbonate reservoir, underlain by 2,000 m salt layer and distant 300 km from the coast. Other characteristics for development are the variable CO2 content and compositional grading with depth of the reservoir fluids, flow assurance issues and special demands concerning subsea engineering, well construction and processing plant. Recognizing reservoir and development uncertainties, Petrobras and its partners have opted for a staged development, based on intensive information gathering, extended well tests (EWTs), multi well production pilots and definitive systems prioritizing the standardization of well projects and production systems. This strategy aimed both accelerated cash flow and dynamic characterization of the reservoir behaviour, subsea gathering system and the processing of fluids in production units. Long term recovery was not forgotten as flexibility was planned for different recovery mechanism as water, gas and water alternating gas (WAG) injection. This paper presents an overview of the main drivers and concepts which served as basis for the development of the prolific pre-salt fields. Pre-salt mega-projects management was early identified as especially challenging: it should assure that the main uncertainties were known and mitigated at project sanction, as well pursuing strategies for CAPEX reduction, on-time long lead items delivery and local content accomplishment, among others. Integration of disciplines and the flexibility were paramount to achieve these goals. The first results are on stream: after only eight years from discovery, production in the Santos Pre-Salt Cluster reached, in February, 2014, 240,000 bopd. This production comes from ten producers; water and gas injection are also being performed. Considering the whole pre-salt reservoirs offshore Brazil, production is over 400,000 bopd. The lessons learned are being considered to optimize the next generation of production systems. Three FPSOs are operating in the Santos Pre-Salt, two additional FPSOs will be installed in 2014, and 8 more until 2016. An oil flow rate of more than 1 million bopd, operated by Petrobras, is expected for 2017. © World Petroleum Council.","Challenges and solutions to develop Brazilian pre-salt deepwater fields","Energy Institute",True,"2014"
"85084024263","Pre-salt carbonate reservoirs are located offshore Brazil at Santos, Campos and Espírito Santo Basins, reaching depths up to 7000 m (22966 ft) and water depths of approximately 2200 m (7218 ft). Most of those reservoirs present very high permeability, resulting in extraordinary oil production rates, imposing, consequently, an onerous task on injector wells to maintain pressure and reservoir mass balance. Part of these injector wells are located in scenarios of inferior permo-porous characteristic and still have their injection rates limited in order to avoid fracture propagation in the reservoirs. To improve the geomechanical models, a series of field tests were carried out to estimate minimum in situ stress and fracture propagation pressure in both reservoir and cap rock. The tests results allowed a change in the criterion for definition of the maximum injection pressure in injector wells. The objective of this work is to present the tests results, how they were performed and the operational problems faced, always seeking the shortest rig time. These results favored the understanding of the reservoir and cap rock behavior.

"85041698761","Extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent in the 21st century bringing significant impacts to coastal ecosystems. However, the capacity to detect and measure those impacts are still limited, with effects largely unstudied. In June 2016, a hailstorm with wind gusts of over 100 km·h−1 caused an unprecedented mangrove dieback on Eastern Brazil. To quantify the scale of impact and short-term recovery of mangroves (15-mo), we used satellite imagery and field sampling to evaluate changes in forest structure in control and impacted areas after the hailstorm. Satellite imagery revealed mangrove dieback in over 500 ha, corresponding to 29.3% of the total forest area suddenly impacted after the hailstorm. Fifteen months after the hailstorm, some impacted areas show an initial recovery, while others continued to degrade. The El Niño years of 2014–2016 created mild drought conditions in Eastern Brazil. As observed in wetlands of semi-arid regions during the same period, mangrove recovery may have been impaired by continued physiological stress and climate change effects. Economic losses in the study site from typical mangrove ecosystem services including food provision, climate regulation, raw materials and nurseries are estimated to at least US$ 792,624 yr−1. This is the first evidence of an extreme weather impact on mangroves in Brazil that typically provide unique ecological and economic subsistence to coastal populations. Our results reveal that there is a pressing need for long-term monitoring and climate change adaptation actions for coastal wetlands in Brazil, and to provide broad estimates of ecosystem values associated with these ecosystems given many areas are already experiencing chronic stress from local impacts, drought and high temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme weather impacts on tropical mangrove forests in the Eastern Brazil Marine Ecoregion","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2018"
"85099301920","The development of Brazil's Offshore fields has been performed using flexible pipes because this pipe technology offers significantly increased flexibility, enabling the movement of pipes between wells and reducing lead time to bring a well onstream as compared to rigid pipe solutions. In addition, the decision of where exactly to drill development wells can be delayed, thus making the drilling campaigns easier, cheaper and faster [1]. With the increased activity in Pre-Salt, some challenges to flexible pipes were uncovered and needed to be addressed, notably oil composition and corrosive agents, e.g. H2S, and, specifically for the case of this paper, CO2. At high pressures, such as found in pre-Salt fields, these contaminants create new Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) failure modes and several mitigation measures have been adopted to overcome them, focused either on the installed fleet or on the next generation of pipes to be delivered. SCC is a condition that induces failure in the pipes' metallic layers, but it needs three elements to occur: water, tensile stress exceeding a critical level and a susceptible material. If one of these three elements is suppressed, the phenomena does not to happen. This paper will cover and present a technology developed to detect the annulus water condition - dry or flooded - and thereby allow a correct integrity management strategy to be adopted. The technology is based on an embedded sensing system together with topside equipment to read the status. The use of such a system is important for the next generation of flexible pipes as it will allow better management of the fleet, with the required measurements performed from the production unit without the need of any support vessel and hence at a reduced cost.

Increased government oversight has also impacted asset development, emphasizing well integrity assurance and operational safety. In turn, intervention tools are being re-engineered to cater to these challenges. Ultrasonic pulse-echo technology has been successfully used for many years for cement evaluation behind casing up to 0.75-in. thick. Conventional ultrasound-based waves, however, cannot generate proper signal levels and penetrate thick-walled casing commonly used in deepwater well completions. However, advanced ultrasonic technology can resolve this issue. Preliminary investigation of various transducer materials and excitation techniques was followed by chamber testing to verify data quality and repeatability over a range of cement slurries and casing sizes. Laboratory results indicate that cement impedance can be reliably obtained behind casing of up to 1.2-in. thick.

"85085774511","The paper discusses how a new burner can solve environmental challenges in well test applications by reducing the quantity of fallout, providing better control of the burning operation, and allowing operators to adjust to changes in the well/weather conditions. In order to conduct successful well tests, substantial amounts of oil must be brought to the surface, and in most instances, the safest and least expensive method of disposal is to burn the produced oil. A quality smoke-free burn and drip-free operation is enabled through an innovative advanced nozzle design installed in this new oil burner. The nozzle can precisely control the flow of oil and air through the burner allowing, for the first time, closure with no unburned fuel escaping. The nozzles are operated remotely and powered by an integrated pneumatic system using the combustion air supply. The system permits control over each individual nozzle, enabling operators to adapt to varying flow conditions to maintain efficient and flawless performance. A wide range of tests were conducted, including combustion zone gas sampling and fallout testing. Over a three week testing period, the new burner flawlessly executed full-scale burns and provided on-the-fly nozzle control, burner head rotation, and instant drip-free shutdowns. The new burner demonstrated its capability to shut down all ten nozzles from their full capacity in three tenths of a second with no visible unburned hydrocarbons or drips. The new burner achieved a 99.99952% fallout efficiency; this is 14.58 times more efficient than any other current oil burner product offering. In addition to the exceptional fallout efficiency, it also delivers 99.4% combustion efficiency and 99.5% destruction efficiency allowing the calculation of CO2 emission rates, which during testing was found to be 41Lbs/MMBtu. The first operation was conducted offshore in Brazil where this new burner demonstrated the capability to control, monitor, and react to changing well conditions for approximately three days without issue. It flowed in excess of 6,700 bbls, preventing a minimum of 69.48 liters of fallout from entering the sea. A total of 32 jobs were performed with the new burner system from December 2014 to January of 2018 with a 100% success rate without contamination/fallouts. The totally eliminated fallout volume, compared with the second most efficient burner system available in the market, is 2653.22 liters after burning a total of 257,490 bbl of hydrocarbons. In 60% of the field jobs, the burner was rotated to accommodate wind direction or to improve burning efficiency. If a different burner system had been used, the burner efficiency would have lessened or, in a worst case scenario, the operation could have been delayed and the well shut in until wind direction changed sufficiently to allow the burning operation.

"68649124056","A discussion covers the new oil and natural gas discoveries by Petrobras from August 2005 to August 2008. The discovery of oil and natural gas by Petrobras in the presalt of the Santos basin, especially Tupi, has come to the attention of the global petroleum industry. Localized in reservoirs that vary from 5,300 to 7,000 m depth (including the water and marine subsoil layers) followed by a salt layer, the new exploratory frontier provides Brazil with the opportunity to become one of the countries with large reserves. The discoveries will add to the present Brazilian reserves of 14 billion bbl. From 2005 to the first half of 2008 discoveries were made in the Santos basin at five exploratory blocks. In one of them, Tupi, 5-8 billion boe were discovered. In the 1980's, Petrobras pioneered in drilling in deep waters in the Campos basin where now oil and gas are produced at 1,886 m of water depth and where technology has been developed to drill up to 3,000 m depth. Following the exploratory success in the Campos basin, exploratory attention in the basins of Santos and Espirito Santo led Petrobras to discover presalt petroleum at a cost of $(US)1 billion. Twenty wells were drilled that yielded light petroleum at 28° API and a large quantity of associated natural gas. In the Santos basin, Petrobras developed new drilling projects through 2,000 m of salt. The first well cost $(US)240 million but today such a well can be drilled for $(US)60 million. The pilot project of Tupi of Petrobras operated with BG (25%) and Galp Energia (10%) lasting until 2010 has an initial production of 100,000 bpd of petroleum and about 3.5 million cu m/day of natural gas. Since its founding, Petrobras has discovered in Brazilian reserves 25 billion bbl of petroleum and natural gas that have produced 11 billion bbl.

"85057560805","This work discusses the regional geological and geophysical datasets (potential field data coupled with seismic lines) available across the Eastern Brazilian Continental Margin and addresses tectonic models that have been applied to the geological interpretation of the Vitória-Trindade Chain (VTC). New magnetic data acquired in the Trindade Island is combined with compiled petrological data and geological maps to propose a stratigraphic column with radiometric control for the volcanic sequences. The gravity and magnetic anomaly maps were integrated with regional seismic profiles extending from the continental platform towards the oceanic crust, showing the geomorphology of the Abrolhos Volcanic Complex (AVC) and the VTC. A detailed geological mapping of the Trindade Island was complemented by magnetometric profiles acquired on the island. The magmatic episodes identified in the Trindade Island within different volcano-stratigraphic sequences are, geochronologically, dated by 40Ar/39Ar method as Late Neogene to Quaternary (Pliocene/Upper Pleistocene) and indicate intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks formed on the Mesozoic (Cretaceous) oceanic crust. Models for the emplacement of these volcanic rocks on much older oceanic crust include hotspots and leaking fracture zones. The presence of flat tops as observed in the volcanic banks and seamounts along the Vitória-Trindade volcanic chain indicate abrasion of much higher volcanic edifices that now form the isolated islands in the Trindade-Martin Vaz Archipelago. Geological mapping and detailed magnetometric surveys suggest different rock properties for distinct volcanic episodes that formed the Trindade Island. The remarkable pattern of magnetic anomalies trending NE-SW in the deep-water region of the Espírito Santo Basin, eastwards of the AVC, suggests that the linear chain of volcanic edifices in the VTC may be associated with mantle anomalies caused by a hotspot or plume that was influenced by the E-W direction of leaking transform fracture zones.

(eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 814-818. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Estuaries provide an appropriate unit for spatial analyses that permit the establishment of environmental management strategies, based on the existing knowledge of their hydrographic basins. The present study developed a diagnostic approach to landscape and environmental management, based on the theoretical concepts of landscape geoecology and environmental planning, and supported by the techniques of remote sensing and thematic cartography. Thematic maps were prepared representing the structures, functions, and dynamics of the natural and cultural geoecological units formed by the estuaries of three Brazilian rivers - the Itapecuru - State of Maranhão and estuarine complex of the Tubarão river - State of Rio Grande do Norte. These maps show the geoecological units and features, indicating their degree of ecodynamic stability, and the evolutionary trends of the propositional scenarios and zoning, with the objective of defining potential strategies for the planning of land use on different functional scales. Theoretical-methodological models of environmental management were proposed, based on landscape geoecology (geosystem analysis, ecodynamics) and environmental planning (thematic cartography, remote sensing) approaches.

"85087345946","Estuarine systems are very sensitive environments to sea level rise as a consequence of climate changes, which can enhance seawater intrusion and affect multiple water uses. The seawater intrusion under sea level scenarios in an estuarine river by applying the one-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model HEC-RAS 5.0.5 was studied. The study was carried out at the estuarine reach of Cubatão River, in São Paulo, Brazil. Considering sea level rise scenarios of ΔH = 0.25 m, 0.50 m, and 1.0 m combined with constant freshwater discharge conditions for Cubatão River (16 m3/s, mean annual discharge and 8 m3/s, dry season discharge), the model results showed that seawater intrusion moves significantly upstream the river in all cases and the maximum seawater intrusion length may reach 10 km in the worst scenario (ΔH = 1.0 m and 8 m3/s freshwater discharge), 70% higher than the current sea level and the mean discharge. At the local water abstraction point for urban supply, salinity concentration may reach 12 g/kg, making conventional water treatment unfeasible. Sea level rise may threaten water supply facilities and require water resource management solutions, such as water abstraction restricted times when salinity concentration is low; higher freshwater reservation; new water abstraction locations, farther the present ones; or higher water discharges in Cubatão River from a local hydroelectric power plant, which can cause water resource management conflicts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Impacts of Sea Level Rise on Seawater Intrusion in Cubatão River, Brazil","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",True,"2020"

Several studies have been carried out to predict the water dynamics inside the moonpool. At most, analytical tools have been used with experimental results, to obtain a good evaluation of viscous effects. Another line of development uses the moonpools as a device to reduce motions of ships or oil platforms. In his context, the use of moonpools in monocolumn type platforms was studied during the development of the concept, through the partnership between PETROBRAS and University of Säo Paulo -USP. An alternative that became viable in the last years is the use of numerical methods to evaluate potencial parameters, being only necessary simple experiments to obtains viscous data to complete the model.

"85088978023","Continental shelves are areas of extreme environmental and economic importance and priority areas for management and planning efforts. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding many tropical shelves, mainly due to high costs associated with surveying large marine areas with traditional techniques. Carbonatic, sediment-starved shelves are distributed across tropical and temperate regions and display characteristics that may allow the application of remote sensing methods, albeit the depth range found in these areas. Thus, this study tested the applicability of Landsat-8 imagery to detect bottom features in a sediment-starved shelf in North-eastern Brazil. The Brazilian Northeast Continental Shelf harbours a variety of geohabitats, including coral and algal reefs, beachrocks, mesophotic reefs, canyons, and paleochannels. Nine scenes were processed following the same steps: radiometric and atmospheric correction, masking, glint removal, water column correction and individual image adjustments. Two scenes were deemed best to portray targeted features. We detected 14 paleochannels in a 9700 km2 area, as well as the shelf break. A pixel-by-pixel analysis using all available bathymetric field data (n = 42,373 pixels) showed that 92.38% of the pixels were accurately classified. Misinterpreted pixels were either due to bordering regions incorrectly identified as paleochannels (3.99%) or paleochannels’ sections undetected in our final mosaic (3.62%). The final mosaic allowed a detailed view of submerged valleys (including previously unmapped channels) distributed up to areas deeper than 100 m using free of charge, medium-resolution satellite imagery. Some of these channels are known fishing grounds and fish spawning aggregation areas, making them priority zones for management and conservation efforts. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study applying Landsat imagery to map paleochannels in submerged areas, and most importantly, in areas deeper than 30 m.

A series of overlapping structures generally can be represented by lineaments marking the successive tectonic events. We studied the NNE structural lineaments corridor in the central region of the Ribeira Belt. We used a digital elevation model (DEM) and new and previous fieldwork data to investigate the structural control of such lineaments and their relevance for the Brazilian continental margin. Our results suggest that the NNE direction is a crustal weakness zone characterising corridors of intense ductile and brittle deformation which was recurrently reactivated. Aligned NNE Neoproterozoic-Ordovician ductile and brittle structures as foliations, shear zones, lithological boundaries, and fractures filled by pegmatitic veins coincide with the lineaments. During the Cretaceous rift, a transtensional sinistral regime generated NNE T-fractures filled by mafic dykes. In the Cenozoic, the NNE direction is represented by transfer and domino faults developed within a mega accommodation zone in an intracontinental rift system.

"37304895","Petrobras has been developing its 4D seismic technological programme since 1998, focused on the Brazilian deep-water fields in the Campos Basin, and considering the technical, operational and economic challenges involved in the development plan and reservoir management in this environment. The first step was to align the objectives of the project with the company goals for the following 15 years, in terms of earnings growth, production growth and reserves replacement. This information guided how the 4D reservoir management should be employed: As hedging technology to ensure that production targets would be achieved in several key fields at once, or as a direct technology investment to increase the production of individual, independent fields. The mission of reservoir management for each field involved was understood and new deep-water seismic technologies were developed to face the global operational and economic targets. 3D seismic reservoir monitoring, or 4D seismic study, was defined as an 'integration of multidisciplinary technologies that includes the time-lapse monitoring of the drainage efficiency, using cores, well logs, seismic data, production history and pressure management'. Water injection is the preferable recovery method for the deep-water reservoirs in Brazil. Therefore, seismic monitoring should be able to distinguish contrasts of both fluids - injected water and remaining oil - that normally produce small seismic impedance values. This characteristic has brought the first technical challenge: the use of the 3D P-wave surface legacy data from the 1980s and 1990s, when the major fields started production, as 4D base-volumes to be correlated with future recommended 3D seismic data (surface or ocean bottom systems) as 4D monitor-volumes. In addition to all developed seismic technologies for data processing, a general 4D work flow was designed and the concept of the integrated reservoir model was adapted to relate all such technologies to the reservoir engineering needs and to the field economics, generating reliable 4D images for each reservoir study. This paper summarizes the multidisciplinary technical integration, including geological and seismic modelling, petrophysical simulations, seismic processing and interpretation, and reservoir simulation. A 4D methodology was implemented to integrate all such technical development and economic analysis, identifying where, when and how seismic monitoring can contribute to the reservoir management. This methodology has been applied to the Campos Basin deep-water reservoir, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.","4D integrated technologies for deep-water turbidite reservoirs: From petrophysics to fluid flow simulation",NULL,True,"2003"
"84987762471","Mangroves are productive ecosystems of tropical coastal landscapes, constituting habitat for many commercial fisheries, as the crab Ucides cordatus. In Brazil this crab holds a major socio-economic importance for artisanal fishery, but with obvious decline on their productivity. In this study we determined and mapped the more suitable mangrove areas for the conservation and fishery of this crab in the São Francisco River Estuary (Northeastern Brazil). We applied a Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) in a GIS environment. Ten criteria in total were used, including crab biotic parameters, land use/cover and social factors. Maps of each criterion were produced by GIS techniques with CBERS and SPOT images and by field data. Mangroves more suitable for the conservation of U. cordatus (9.4 km2) are near to the river mouth, due to high density and frequency of non-commercial size crabs (NCSC), low density of commercial size crabs (CSC), small crabs and low degree of use for fishery. On the other hand, the mangroves for the crab fishery occurred with a similar area (10.2 km2) located farther away from the river mouth, with a high density and frequency of CSC, low density of NCSC, big crabs, medium-high degree of use for fishery and near to the villages.

"85074778611","Overfishing is a concerning threat that can lead to the collapse of fish stocks. We assessed the combinations of factors, including biological traits, types of exploitation and responses to sea temperature and salinity changes, that drive species to collapse in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) tropical and subtropical regions. We applied a catch-based method of stock classification and a catch time series of 61 years from 132 exploited fish species. Species were categorized as Collapsed, Overexploited, Fully Exploited or in Development, and we used a GAM analysis to understand their categorization over time. Furthermore, a Redundancy Analysis was developed to assess the species characteristics that best predicted each exploitation category. Twelve species were classified as Collapsed, 55 as Overexploited, 46 as Fully Exploited and 19 as in Development. Tropical and subtropical exploited species collapses in Brazil were best explained by a complex combination of a negative impact of warmer sea temperatures, fishery exploitation and specific life-history traits. A synergistic interaction between these factors could bring species to collapse. We hypothesize that the exploitation of species with vulnerable traits may alter how these species respond to temperature and, therefore, lead them to collapse given that intense exploitation may affect their ability to respond to temperature increases. Measures to mitigate climate change impacts should take into consideration incentives to decrease the exploitation of vulnerable species and, specifically, consider species with more sensitive biological traits. Such measures are also important to minimize the socioeconomic impacts on the people that depend on these species. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Assessing drivers of tropical and subtropical marine fish collapses of Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2020"

The industry 4.0 brings an opportunity to transform systems and processes to be more efficient, making use of digitalization and new technologies, including the use of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to engineering problems. In Brazilian offshore fields, the operating conditions for flexible riser applications (deep-water, mean wave frequencies, floating units and corrosive fluids) make the metallic layer’s fatigue failure mode one of the drivers in its design. In a daily basis, nonlinear dynamic finite element analysis uses regular wave scatter diagrams as an equivalent way to model the wave elevation, avoiding the time consuming irregular wave representation. The analysis performed with regular waves are faster but carries conservatisms with it. In a deep-water scenario, the wave height and period ranges of the wave scatter diagram can be refined to improve the fatigue results obtained, leading to a considerable increase in the total amount of wave classes that need to be evaluated. Great part of the wave classes has a very low participation in the total fatigue damage, spending an unnecessary time to analyze them. Helped by a robust design of simulation experiment (DoSE) and machine learning regressors, a lean representation of the regular wave scatter can be done, where some of them are simulated and the rest of the results can be accurately predicted. This paper presents the application of supervised learners that are used to predict riser fatigue damage at different riser locations, given partial simulations of a regular wave scatter diagram. The techniques support the strategy to reduce the total amount of fatigue analysis required within a project design phase. The focus stays on the evaluation of the fatigue of metallic layers at two main critical regions, bend stiffener and touch down zone. Hidden patterns inside each scatter diagram are discovered, minimizing the total number of finite element analysis (FEA) required. The amount of the wave class reduction starts from 50% going up to 75%, maintaining a good level of accuracy on the predicted damage values.

The application of a top-down modeling approach is necessary, as the size of oil fields discoveries is usually confidential data and therefore not disclosed in Brazil. Despite fragilities of curve fitting methodologies, this approach therefore continues being widely used, due to its simplicity and relatively low data requirement. The classic Hubbert methodology was improved in this study by considering the asymmetry of production. Additionally, a hybrid model considering techno-economic aspects explains the deviation of the crude oil production rate from the prediction of the Hubbert curve by means of regression analysis. This analysis indicates that the deviation of the crude oil production rate from the Hubbert curve follows, with a four-to five-year lag, changes in oil price. The findings show that the URR of Brazil's post-salt offshore basins hover between 15 and 21 billion barrels of oil. An annual average growth rate of 8% in the pre-salt oil fields can compensate for the decline in post-salt offshore oil production for the period 2016-2025.

The resolution of the 2D seismic data analyzed allowed the identification of three levels of erosional surfaces and their subsequent filling, from smaller to higher: composite channels, channel complexes and channel complexes set. Channel complexes development is related to lowstand deposits on the continental slope. Also, the aspect ratio of the channel complexes analyzed are reverse to the expected for channel development on continental slope settings. Usually, the further down-dip the channels are located, the higher their aspect ratio, however, it does not happen in the study case. Most of down-dip channels show a lower aspect ratio. It is ascribed to the control of the seafloor topography by the halokinetics.

Our results show that metal(loid) concentrations significantly increased with time after the disaster and changed their chemical partitioning in the water. 35.2 mg Fe L−1 and 14.4 mg Al L−1 were observed in the total (unfiltered) water during the acute stage, while aqueous Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se and Zn concentrations all exceeded both Brazilian and international safe levels for water quality. The Al, Fe and Pb partitioning coefficient log (Kd) decrease in the acute stage could be related to the high colloid content in the tailings. We continued to observe high concentrations for Al, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, V and Zn mainly in the particulate fraction during the chronic stage. Furthermore, the Doce river estuary had been previously contaminated by As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni and Pb, with a further increase in sediment through the tailing release (e.g. 9-fold increase for Cr, from 3.61 ± 2.19 μg g−1 in the pre-impact to 32.16 ± 20.94 μg·g−1 in the chronic stage).

Although based on the state of art procedures used for SPAR platforms, the monocolumn experiments considered the different geometry of this concept and the larger susceptibility to the three-dimensional effects, due to the smaller relation draft/beam. Special attention was given to the ratio roughness/beam in order to guarantee similarity between the experiments and its respective real cases. Additionally, different heading conditions were also tested. Thus, the present work presents a set of preliminary results and discussions concerning VIM of monocolumn floaters and its impact on the mooring line design and riser specification.

"85090693617","Foraminifera have demonstrated to be a good proxy of climatic changes during the Cenozoic for their high preser-vation in the sediment and quick responses to environmental changes. The aim of this study is to identify climate changes and the variation of marine influence during the Late Holocene, in Piraquê-Açu River Estuary (ES, Brazil). The study was based on the characterization of benthic foraminifera assemblages, δ13C and δ18O data in Ammonia tepida tests and the PA05 (2411 B.P.) and PA20 (1632 B.P.) cores. A total of 16 benthic foraminiferal species were identified in the cores. Some of them are characteristic from continental shelf environment (e.g. Lagena spp., Spiroloculina eximia, Oolina spp., Pyrulina gutta, Cibicidoides variabilis) and four are typical estuarine species (Ammonia parkinsoniana, A. tepida, Cri-broelphidium excavatum and Bolivina striatula). The results allow us to identify four colder periods in the sedimentary record such as: the end of Iron Age (≈ 1000 B.C.), Greek Dark Ages (≈450 B.C.-100 B.C.), Dark Ages (≈250 A.D.-550 A.D.) and the Litter Ice Age (≈1200 A.D. and 1850 AD.). In these periods the estuary showed an increase in confinement, which can be seen by the reduction in ecological indexes values and by the presence of only typically estuarine foramini-fera species. Four warming periods were recorded in the sedimentary sequence: Greek Warming Period (≈ 900 B.C.-450 B.C.), Roman Warming Period (≈ 50 A.D.-250 A.D.), Medieval Warming Period (≈550 A.D.-1200 A.D.), and the fourth event represents the warming that started since the beginning of 19th Century. During warming events, the ecological indexes show higher values and species of marine habit were more constant in the sedimentary record. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

These modeling systems can be run as fully coupled atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-ocean-wave configurations. Examples of several modeling systems applied to complex coastal regions including Madeira Island, Adriatic Sea, Coastal California, Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and the Maritime Continent are presented. In many of these studies, a variety of field campaigns have contributed to a better understanding of the underlying physics associated with the atmosphere-ocean feedbacks.

"85085774498","Brazil is entering the age of decommissioning, with aging offshore fields that have been in operation for more than 25 years. Brazil has migrated from an operator's monopolistic environment (with the state owned oil company, Petrobras) to a new reality in which many companies, national and international operate in Brazilian waters. As part of this new reality, Brazil has established government organizations whose aim is to coordinate the exploitation of Brazil's natural resources with the intent of optimizing activities while protecting the environment in an ever increasingly complex eco-system management. Traditionally, offshore projects follow basic phases such as conceptual, front end engineering and design (FEED), detail design, construction and commissioning. Cost allocation and schedules for these phases are all associated with production estimates and return on investment estimates. In many instances, internationally, planning for decommissioning has been deferred to an unforeseen future. Finally that far off horizon has become a reality, and domestic and foreign operators in Brazil are going through a new decommissioning awareness phase. It is the author's opinion that operators wish to comply with a well-defined frame of Brazilian and international regulations. In general, this paper aims at examining the existing regulatory environment and make recommendations on a path forward for: • Clear-cut requirements so that the permitting process flows with a minimized review cycle; • A clear set of rules, defining what abandonment options exist (e.g. complete removal vs. partial removal, on-site abandonment rules for topsides and subsea infrastructure); • A clear set of rules defining fines and sanctions for environmental violations The objectives of this paper are to 1) Gather basic information on the current status of the Brazilian Rules and Regulations, 2) Help non-government entities work together to accomplish the goals set forth by Brazilian lawmakers and officials, and 3) Develop a roadmap for convergence of the environmental agency and project stakeholders.

"85053143769","This study measured the wake effect in a Brazilian onshore windfarm with 38 turbines located in complex terrain. The proposed methodology calculated the wind deficit in 3 different metmasts, by comparing the measurement periods in free-of-wake condition to measurement periods under wake effect. Uncertainties due to wind variability and seasonality effects have been avoided by performing MCP (Measure Correlate Predict) procedures making use of a fourth metmast in free-of-wake condition during the entire concurrent period. This methodology is free of uncertainties from Nacelle anemometry, power curve measurements and micrositing models’ spatial extrapolation. The calculation of the wind deficits was performed per sector, confirming the adherence of the resulting wake effect to the turbine layout configuration. Higher wind deficits were identified in the sectors were turbines under operation are present in the upwind direction. The results were combined to the power curves from the turbines closest to the metmasts, using the data from the turbine supplier's technical specification. This allowed the identification of the respective power deficit due to the wake effect in these locations. The calculated wind- and power deficits were compared to the results of wake models used by two large international wind farms site assessment consultants (Coupled Eddy Viscosity and PARK), commonly accepted by banks for the financing of wind farms in Brazil. The results indicated that both models underestimate the effects in all 3 analyzed locations, with differences between the calculated and modeled power deficits higher than the respective uncertainties provided by both consultants. The two main limitations of this analysis lie in the restriction of the wake effect measurement to the metmasts locations, and in that the results are respective to the terrain conditions of the analyzed wind farm. However, this study indicates that commonly used wake models need to be further developed and calibrated for onshore wind farms. The literature shows that wake models developments are frequently directed to offshore wind farms, where wake effects play a significant role. Onshore wind farms are less studied, even though the global installed capacity greatly surpasses that of the offshore wind farms. Brazil has by the end of 2017 already 12.8 GW of installed capacity of wind power plants, and this number continues to increase steadily. With the continuous concentration of operating wind farms in regions of higher wind resource and transmission infrastructure, wake effects play a significant role in the sector. Bibliography shows that commonly used wake models tend to underestimate the energy losses due to this effect in offshore wind farms, making it important to study it also in onshore wind farms in complex terrain, which is the case of most Brazilian wind farms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Wake effect measurement in complex terrain - A case study in Brazilian wind farms","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2018"
"85088133476","The present study deals with bioavailability of trace metals in the Doce river continental shelf, southeast of Brazil. The bottom sediments of the study area were firstly sampled a few weeks before the biggest environmental disaster of Brazil, the collapse of the Fundão dam in November of 2015. The disaster released around 40 Mm3 of iron ore tailings into Doce river basin and an estimate of 10 Mm3 reached the river delta, having the adjacent continental shelf as the final destination. One year and a half later, on April of 2017, the continental shelf was sampled again. A total of 48 stations were evaluated concerning concentrations of trace metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr) and other ancillary variables before and after the accident. Trace metals were determined through fractionation in order to assess mobility and establish the ecological risk through RAC index. Before the accident, trace metals mobility was Pb &gt; Ni &gt; Cu &gt; Zn &gt; Cr, with Pb Cu, Ni and posing high ecological risk (RAC&gt;30%) in many stations. Differences in concentrations of metal from pre to post accident were significant, and the increase of trace metals was observed. The mobility order after the accident changed to: Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Ni &gt; Zn &gt; Cr. Metal fractionation showed remarkable changes after the accident, with elements such as Cu, Ni and Zn highly associated with reducible fractions originated from the tailings composition. Despite the decrease of RAC to medium risk after the accident in most stations, the bioavilability of Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn increased as show by their higher accumulation in the bioavailable fractions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioavailability and ecological risks of trace metals in bottom sediments from Doce river continental shelf before and after the biggest environmental disaster in Brazil: The collapse of the Fundão dam","Academic Press",True,"2020"

"68649086917","Exploration for oil under the salt layer is concentrated in the basins of Santos, Campos, and Espiritu Santo, Brazil. Hopefully it extends to the eastern margin of the Jequitinhonha and Camamu-Almada basins. These basins have been unexplored under the salt layer with respect to the present objectives. One Petrobras estimate is that there may be thousands of millions bbl of reserves of light petroleum under the salt in the Campos basin. Because of the urgency to import light oil to mix with heavy crude oil that is the major part of Brazilian production in the old Petrobras refineries and as a result of the immense oil discoveries of Tertiary/Cretaceous in the 1970's and 1980's and the first half of the 1990's, Brazilian exploration concentrates mainly in the reserves of the Tertiary and Cretaceous Superior of the Campos basin. Exploration under the salt layer in Campos and other basins has been sporadic. It is difficult to calculate the cost of developing the fields under the salt layer in Brazil but the costs could exceed any borne to date. If the layer under the salt becomes an object of commercial exploration, the development of the fields could reach $2,000 to $4,000 million or more. In the last 5 yr heavy lacustrian petroleum and gas accumulations have been found in the reservoirs of Tertiary and Cretaceous Superior in the Campos basin. These are formed mainly by biodegradation. As a result of this, giant deposits of petroleum/gas are expected under the Tertiary Superior and the Cretaceous of Marlim, Albacora, Roncador, Barracuda, Jubarte, Cachalote, Golfinho, and the petroleum accumulation BSS-69 and elsewhere. A number of historic and current oil and gas production figures are given for various Petrobras fields. In the Espírito Santobasin the potential reserves of light oil are about 600 MM boe, most of which in deep waters. Petrobras produces light oil in 87 fields 12 of which are maritime (as of 2005). Brazil produces up to 1.76 MM bpd of petroleum of which about 70% is heavy oil. The average production of gas has been 43.9 MM cu m/day as of September 2006. Probable reserves in Brazil are 11.36 B bbl of oil and 297 B cu m of gas.","The layer under the salt as a promising exploratory frontier for Brazil.

"85070991202","Near-inertial oscillations (NIO) are intermittent motions with a frequency close to the inertial frequency and represent an important fraction of the energy to the currents in the upper ocean. Based on hourly velocity records at the shelf break covering the top 50 m of the water column in 5 locations and one additional location at Cabo Frio upwelling system (22° S) covering the top 200 m of water column with hourly velocity and temperature measurements, the aim of the present study is to characterize NIO along the Brazilian continental shelf break (16° S–31.5° S) describing the spatial variability of inertial energy in the mixed layer and the role of the NIO in the high-frequency hydrodynamic. The sites between 31.5° S and 28.5° S were those that revealed more near-inertial energy and higher relative importance of the near-inertial band for the variance of the currents (29% and 31%, respectively). This is associated with the proximity between the inertial frequency and the sea breeze frequency in this region, which delimits an inertial resonance area for the NIO around 30° S. The near-inertial currents between 31.5° S and 23.5° S range between 30 and 50 cm s−1 and decrease toward the locations at lower latitudes, where the range is between 5 and 25 cm s−1. Vertical shear of the order of 10−3 s−1 was reached during NIO events between 31.5° S and 23.5° S in the upper layer of the ocean (mixed layer, seasonal thermocline, and upper permanent thermocline) and can play an important role in the vertical mixing along the Brazilian continental shelf break. The NIO events analyzed at Cabo Frio upwelling system exhibited a mean duration of around 7.6 days, upward vertical phase velocity of the order of 10−1 cm s−1, vertical wavelengths of the order of 102 m, and vertical downward group velocity of the order of 10−2 cm s−1. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the vertical propagation of energy and duration of the events demonstrate the importance of NIO as a source of kinetic energy to the ocean interior. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Observations of near-inertial oscillations along the Brazilian continental shelf break","Springer Verlag",True,"2019"
"85085850094","This case focuses on the challenges regarding capacity building required to meet the huge increase of manpower demand by the offshore and shipbuilding sectors in Brazil and Rio Grande do Sul state. This arises from four key factors: end of monopoly of exploration and production of oil and gas in 1997, expanding the Brazilian offshore market; the Local Content policy adopted since 1999; national programs to stimulate the maritime industry such as the Fleet Modernization and Expansion Program created in 2004 to renew the fleet of Transpetro, a Petrobras subsidiary; and the expansion of Petrobras investments, partly due to the discovery of giant oil reserves in the Pre-salt layer in Brazil, in 2006. Since 2010, annual investments from Petrobras have reached US$ 40 billion/year, more than ten times the yearly investment in the 1997-2001 period. Consequently, offshore clusters have been developed in the country to build platforms, drilling ships and supply vessels, demanding massive training. In Rio Grande do Sul, three big shipyards and modules producers have installed. In this context, government created in 2003 the National Oil and Natural Gas Industry Mobilization Program (Prominp) and the National Plan of Professional Qualification (Pnqp) in 2006. Until 2013, circa US$ 120 million were invested to train nearly 100.000 people in 185 trades at several levels. In the state, training has been provided mainly by SENAI-RS, the state branch of the National Service of Industrial Apprenticeship, linked to the Federation of the Industries of Rio Grande do Sul. The large-scale actions undertaken for training have not been efficacious enough to meet the needs. Studies and discussions have raised factors that impact on shipyards' productivity and competitiveness. We consider alternatives to develop talents to accelerate the learning curve, anchored in the following axes: SENAI methodology for professional training; pre-selection of people according to specific abilities; the concept of a ""Living Lab"" training environment; familiarizing workers with productiveness indicators; efficient management paradigm; workers training aligned with the project repeatability principle.

The data indicate the predominance of pollen types from the Atlantic Forest in all samples and a relatively low representation of mangrove pollen, suggesting distant (regional) fluvial transport. Avicennia and Rhizophora were represented in those samples closer to the intertidal zone, Rhizophora being the most important. It was possible to verify a marked difference in pollen concentration/deposition among the three rivers, probably related to the different hydrodynamic pattern of each river. A low concentration of palynomorphs occurred in the Macacú-Guapimirim River, resulting from its higher flow, and there was a high deposition of palynomorphs in the sediments of Guaraí River, in response to its isolation from the hydrographic Guanabara Bay basin. It was possible to verify other interesting data, such as low palynomorph concentration in samples from near the mouth and an increase of palynomorphs in the upstream samples, mainly due to the more active action of the tidal currents. Meanwhile, the increase in the total concentration of the palynomorphs in the upstream samples coincides with the maximum reach of the saline waters and their meeting with the internal flow of the rivers. © 2019, © 2019 AASP–The Palynological Society.","Fluvial pollen deposition in a mangrove ecosystem in south-eastern Brazil","Taylor and Francis Inc.",True,"2019"

Part of this literature points out transformations on the institutional arrangements, when they are formalized and recognized by the State. This article presents the co-management instruments of Brazilian Marine Extractive Reserves and an analysis of their formal arrangements evolution, based on secondary data and an assessment of pertinent legislation since the first Resex decree. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 managers of Coastal and Marine Resex. The interviews aimed to identify all co-management instruments used in each Resex, their stage of implementation as well as the managers’ perception on these instruments. We consider co-management instruments as formal arrangements that require participatory procedures or that act as arenas for decision-making. The results show that the legacy of the rubber tappers social movement in 80’s, which created an inclusive model of protected area, is presented in the formal arrangements established over time. The instruments for co-management are divided into instruments of territorial recognition and beneficiaries, instruments for land use planning, arenas for discussion and deliberation, as well as public policies for Resex. This institutional framework has become increasingly robust over time, although it still needs to be improved. Part of the challenges include a reduction on bureaucratic procedures for the formal recognition of these instruments and the technocratic logic of the State that is often exercising tutelage rather than social emancipation of traditional people. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Contingency planning for cetaceans in oil spills is now becoming an important element for preparedness for some countries. The cetacean response in Guanabara Bay specifically targeted a pod of about 70 members of the species Sotalia fluviatilis, a small dolphin that inhabits the bay. The response included the development of a plan that included a response system, a monitoring program and action plans. The response system detailed the mechanism for the plan to work and adopted the incident control management system. The monitoring program related to the study of any short term or long term deleterious effects resulting from the spill and consisted of basic spatial, temporal and behavioural studies. Action plans were developed specific to the character of Guanabara Bay and included the rescue and rehabilitation strategies necessary to respond to oil affected cetaceans.

"85052069920","Deep-sea fans have been proposed to act as carbon sinks, rapid deposition driving shallow methanogenesis to favor net storage within the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Here, we present new evidence of widespread gas venting from the GHSZ on the upper Amazon deep-sea fan, together with analyses of the first samples of gas hydrates recovered offshore NE Brazil. Multibeam water column and seafloor imagery over an 18,000-km2 area of the upper Amazon fan reveal 53 water column gas plumes, rising from venting features in water depths of 650–2600 m. Most gas vents (60%) are located along seafloor faults that record the ongoing gravitational collapse of the fan above deep décollements, while others (40%) are located in water depths of 650–715 m within the upper edge of the GHSZ. Gas compositions from hydrates recovered in vents at three locations on and north of the fan indicate biogenic sources (dominantly methane with 2–15% of CO2; δ13C from − 81.1 to − 77.3‰), whereas samples from vents adjacent to the fan proper include possible thermogenic contributions (methane 95%, CO2 4%, and ethane 1%; δ13C – 59.2‰). These results concur with previous findings that the upper edge of the GHSZ may be sensitive to temporal changes in water temperatures, but further point to the importance of gas escape from within areas of gas hydrate stability. Our results suggest the role of fluid migration along pathways created by faulting within rapidly deposited passive margin depocenters, which are increasingly recognized to undergo gravitational collapse above décollements. Our findings add to evidence that gas can escape from sediments to the sea in areas where gas hydrates are stable on passive margins, and suggest the need of further studies of the dynamics of deep-sea depocenters in relation to carbon cycling. © 2018, The Author(s).","Gas seeps and gas hydrates in the Amazon deep-sea fan","Springer Verlag",True,"2018"
"85085779144","ULTRA™ is a novel and advanced flow assurance coating technology recently introduced in the Brazilian market for upcoming, and challenging, offshore projects expected in the next years. This coating technology has been used for over 9 years, and has been designed, applied and installed in offshore projects worldwide. Particularly over the last year, this thermal insulation system has been applied for a major project in Brazil. It is a thermal insulation system composed of fusion bonded epoxy and styrenic materials. A base 3-layer coating, followed by one or more insulation layers of solid or foamed styrene, and a high ductility outer shield were engineered to outperform some of existing solutions in terms of hydrostatic pressure, subsea stability, overall insulation thickness and associated installation costs. Application trials have been successfully performed to validate plant capabilities for applying the wide range of styrene-based system solutions, for shallow and deep waters. Test results demonstrated that foam and solid versions have a sweet spot in which the system outperforms similar to the wet insulation solutions existing in the Brazilian market. Its solid and foam systems demonstrated capability of delivering lower U - values (Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient) due to their lower thermal conductivity. The benefit of lower thermal conductivity is reflected in a reduced coating thickness and opportunities for potential savings during the transportation and installation activities. In the coming years, the offshore industry in Brazil will demand wet insulation systems delivering improved thermal performance. Hence, lower U value with lower CAPEX and in deeper water depths.

A clear rainfall effect on the investigated abiotic variables was observed, with increased rainfall and temperatures noted at the end of the study period. Significant statistical correlations were observed between THg concentrations and the assessed abiotic variables at the three study points at the beginning and end of the rainy season. The rainy season was noted as directly affecting THg concentrations at Guanabara Bay and, consequently, swimming crab THg contents. THg concentrations in swimming crabs at Urca and at the Cagarras Islands were higher at the beginning of the rainy season compared to the end, while the opposite was observed for the sampling point outside the bay. Higher Hg concentrations were detected at the outermost point of the bay in relation to the Cagarras Islands, probably due to the local upwelling event. THg values in Callinectes sp. were higher than concentrations reported for other areas in Brazil but lower than other reports worldwide. Calculated THg intakes surpassed the maximum National Research Council permissible limits of 0.049 mg/week at all sampling stations during both seasons, raising public health concerns. Further research for longer monitoring periods during different seasons are essential to ascertain which climatic period is most critical regarding Hg availability at this anthropogenically-impacted estuary. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Seasonal influences on swimming crab mercury levels in an eutrophic estuary located in southeastern Brazil","Springer",True,"2020"
"85085298469","Coquinas constitute widespread deposits in lacustrine, estuarine, and shallow marine settings, where they are a valuable source of information on environmental conditions. Thick coquina successions were deposited in a series of lacustrine rift basins that formed along the Brazilian Continental Margin during the early stages of the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, in the Early Cretaceous. In the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, the coquina sequence, equivalent to the Morro do Chaves Formation, crops out in the Atol Quarry, and is considered a relevant analog for the economically important hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Pre-salt strata (Barremian to Aptian) of the Campos Basin (Pampo, Badejo, and Linguado oil fields), which occur only in the subsurface. The aim of this study is to generate a depositional and stratigraphic model through facies and stratigraphic analyses of a well core. These analyses allowed the geological characterization of the Morro do Chaves Formation and of its transition to the adjacent stratigraphic units, the Coqueiro Seco Formation above and the Penedo Formation below, contributing to the growing knowledge of sedimentation in rift basins and exploratory models in hydrocarbon-producing reservoirs. Facies analysis consists of sedimentological, taphonomic, and stratigraphic features of the rocks. Fourteen depositional facies were recognized, stacked into low-frequency and high-frequency, deepening-upward and shallowing-upward cycles driven by the interaction between climate and tectonism. A depositional model is presented, based on the correlation between well-core and outcrop data described in previous studies, providing insights into the spatial distribution of facies. The detailed analysis of facies and stacking patterns sheds light on depositional processes, paleoenvironmental conditions, and the evolution of the system through time, so we may better understand analogous deposits in the geological record. © 2020, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology)","Bioclastic accumulation in a lake rift basin: The Early Cretaceous coquinas of the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, Brazil","SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology",True,"2020"
"85084454298","Antifouling biocides, such as irgarol and diuron, are commonly used in antifouling paints. Recently, studies carried out in a Brazilian region of ecological concern have warned for extremely high levels of these biocides. So, this work focused on a 4-year (2015–2018) evaluation considering the occurrence, environmental fate, seasonal variations and ecological risk assessment of irgarol and diuron in water and sediment from São Marcos Bay, Brazil, which is an area of international relevance located in the Amazon region. The results showed the ubiquitous presence of antifouling biocides, as well as their wide distribution along the bay. The concentration range of irgarol was between &lt;0.8 and 89.4 ng L−1 in water and between &lt;0.5 and 9.2 ng g−1dw in sediments, whereas diuron showed a range between &lt;1.4 and 22.0 ng L−1 in water and between &lt;2.0 and 15.0 ng g−1dw in sediments. The distribution of the biocides was mainly related to the intense Bay hydrodynamics. The environmental risk assessment showed that irgarol and diuron posed “high risk” to the aquatic biota of São Marcos Bay, exceeding international Environmental Quality Guidelines. The results represent a robust study on the environmental fate of such biocides and intend to be a useful data source for eventual legislation since regulation concerning antifouling substances is necessary for Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Antifouling biocides as a continuous threat to the aquatic environment: Sources, temporal trends and ecological risk assessment in an impacted region of Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2020"

The system is based on a VLCC vessel, moored in DICAS (Differential Compliance Anchoring) system and presents a reasonably large riser porch on the portside for 77 lines. In this paper the dynamic behavior of the offshore system is evaluated using Dynasim, a time-domain simulation code for moored offshore systems, developed by the University of São Paulo and Petrobras. Simulations are compared with experimental results. Two kinds of tests were performed: ""Calibration"" tests were carried out in order to obtain static coefficients of the hull under isolated current and wind loads. ""Validation"" tests were conducted to evaluate the dynamic behavior under extreme environmental conditions combining current and wave excitation. First and second-order motions were measured as well as mooring line tensions for three different drafts of the ship.

"85031996233","The Sapinhoá and Lula North-East fields, 300km offshore Rio de Janeiro, Brazil are the two pilot fields of the Pre-salt development strategy. Field architecture consists of satellite wells connected to a spread moored FPSO in each of the fields. Through a design competition Petrobras and Partners selected the de-coupled riser system developed by Subsea 7. In each field two BSRs (Buoy Supporting Risers) anchored at 250m below waterline support the rigid risers on one side and flexible flowlines running to the FPSO on the other. Each BSR displaces close to 10,000t of water and provides a nominal net up thrust of 3,250t. This Paper highlights the engineering challenges and the solution developed for the large-scale foundation anchors that support these massive BSRs in the harsh environment of the Santos Basin in 2140m water depth. Vertically below each corner of the BSR tank an 8m diameter by 18m penetration suction anchor houses the receptacles for the pair of tethers. Tension in the tethers was tuned to optimise the system stiffness (to minimise lateral BSR excursion orbits and avoid clash of risers and FPSO mooring lines) while requiring minimum anchor capacity. Four ballast modules of 150t each sit on top of each suction anchor to provide the remainder of the required uplift resistance. Soil conditions across both fields consist of soft silty clay. A geotechnical FE model of the suction anchor in Abaqus was used to evaluate the interaction of the structure, surrounding soil and trapped water beneath the top cap. The model was used to develop the complete load-displacement curves of the system during the undrained design current events. A consolidation FE model using the Soft Soil model in PLAXIS showed that the hybrid anchor/ballast system under sustained uplift loading is stable throughout the design life for the level of sustained design load. Although the LRFD verification format of suction anchors and gravity anchors are well covered in the design codes, there seems to be a gap in the coverage of this particular type of hybrid anchor. The governing condition was found to be the long term drained pull-out capacity under sustained loading with the assumption of slowly leaking suction port and air evacuation port at the top.

"84865218536","Creating an accurate subsurface model is paramount to many geophysical and geological workflows. Examples are background models for seismic inversion, rock property models for reservoir characterization, and geological models of depositional elements for seismic morphological interpretation. The standard workflow for creating subsurface models using seismic data is stratal slicing. The stratal slicing approach, however, may break down in the case of complex stratigraphic or tectonic structuring, such as shelf-to-basin clinoforms, delta lobe switching, deep-water channel-fan complexes, and deformation due to salt tectonics. This paper illustrates how the results obtained with high-resolution inversion and the incorporation of a stratigraphically consistent low-frequency model generated through horizon mapping - called the HorizonCube - improves the quality of the estimation of the subsurface parameters in structural complex settings. Using two data examples with different seismic data and geological settings from the North Sea and offshore Brazil, the paper will demonstrate the increased accuracy of the final inversion result using a data-driven HorizonCube. © 2012 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Extracting full-resolution models from seismic data to minimize systematic errors in inversion: Method and examples","Society of Exploration Geophysicists",True,"2012"
"58849128774","There are several oil fields offshore Brazil with horizontal oil density variations. API tracking, that is available in some commercial finite difference simulators, can deal with such cases by allowing definition of an initial oil gravity distribution and tracking variations of oil density, due to the movement of oil. Streamline-based simulators can be much faster than conventional finite difference simulators when applied to large and heterogeneous models. However, this approach is most accurate and efficient when it is assumed that the rock and fluids are incompressible. In previous work (Beraldo et al, 2007), an incompressible formulation for streamline simulation with an API Tracking option using two components in the oleic phase was presented. This paper presents a compressible formulation for streamlines that also considers API tracking. It extends the work of Cheng et al. (2006) and Osako and Datta-Gupta (2007) by consistently accounting for flux of mass and volume along streamlines. It was described how mass and volume can be mapped between the underlying grid and streamlines to minimize mass balance errors and how consideration of cumulative volume in a streamline can substitute for time-of-flight (Beraldo 2008). The method was implemented in a three-dimensional two-phase streamline-based simulator. Tests based on a Brazilian oilfield model and on the SPE10th Comparative Case demonstrate that the implementation can reproduce the results of a conventional simulator, while being substantially faster for finely-resolved models, even when compressibility is significant.","Streamline simulation with compressibility and spatial and dynamic variation in oil composition","Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE)",True,"2008"

It was evaluated the potential for oil generation, identifying the type and degree of maturation of the organic matter. Optical analyzes show that the organic matter is composed in greater proportion by amorphous organic matter in good preservation, with high fluorescence. It also presents a 67% average concerning the total composition of the kerogen. The phytoclasts usually are well preserved in almost all the section. The palynomorphs are composed of an association, predominantly, of spores and pollen grains of genus Classopollis, featuring a predominantly arid to semi-arid climate environment at deposition time. Presence of the dinoflagellate in the upper section displays the first marine ingressions that happened in the end of Aptian. Based on the qualitative and quantitative results of kerogen, it was possible to characterize three distinct palynofacies, in which the palynofacies I had the best features for quality and preservation of organic matter. The results show total organic carbon values up to 6.39% and Rock-Eval pyrolysis data pointed to the type II kerogen rich in organic matter suitable for the formation of hydrocarbon accumulations. The hydrogen index is found between 200 and 550 mg HC/g of total organic carbon, which shows good potential for oil and gas generation. Spore color index data conclude that the organic matter is found predominantly on the immature maturation phase, with SCI values of 4.0 to 4.5, corroborating with data of maximum temperature, of up to 432° C.","Evaluation of the potential generator Aptian-Albian oil section of the Sergipe Basin, integrating palynofacies and organic geochemistry analyses [Avaliação do potencial gerador de petróleo da seção Aptiana-Albiana da Bacia de Sergipe,integrando análises palinofaciológicas e dados de geoquímica orgânica]","Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia",True,"2014"
"85090511016","Well production in oil fields is a dynamic and complex activity. The patterns and characteristics inherent to the well, such as pressures and flow rates, are changing based on production time and the fluid composition - a complex multiphase mixture composed of oil, water, and gas. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate well behavior with periodic production tests. This paper proposes an automatic tool based on machine learning models to assist the production tests validation process in a quick manner. The developed methodology was applied to 13 representative wells of a Brazilian offshore oil field. For each examined well, a dataset is created with operation variables obtained from valid and invalid production tests. Six classification algorithms are analyzed, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in reason to automatically label a new production test as valid or invalid, according to production historical data for the well. The dataset was divided into training and validation sets. The training set was used to perform feature selection, to calibrate and choose the proper model. The validation set was then used at the end of the procedure to evaluate obtained results, by comparing the model's output with real test labels. From the results obtained in the case study, it was possible to identify that IGLR (Injection Gas/Liquid Ratio), oil flow rate and the pressure loss between wellhead and platform were representatives for most of the wells, which implies that these variables have a huge influence at the production well test validation. Furthermore, the validation set indicates that SVM and logistic regression were the models with the best performance. Besides that, accurate results were achieved, since the model correctly classified at least 5 of the 6 tests in 70% of wells analyzed, and for the remaining wells, 4 of 6 production tests.

Here, we use spatial planning to design an enforcement strategy for a pre-existing spatial closure for artisanal fisheries considering climate variability, existing seasonal fishing closures, representative conservation targets and enforcement costs. We calculated enforcement cost in three ways, based on different assumptions about who could be responsible for monitoring the fishery. We applied this approach in the Patos Lagoon estuary (Brazil), where we found three important results. First, spatial priorities for enforcement were similar under different climate scenarios. Second, we found that the cost and percentage of area enforced varied among scenarios tested by the conservation planning analysis, with only a modest increase in budget needed to incorporate climate variability. Third, we found that spatial priorities for enforcement depend on whether enforcement is carried out by a central authority or by the community itself. Here, we demonstrated a method that can be used to efficiently design enforcement plans, resulting in the conservation of biodiversity and estuarine resources. Also, cost of enforcement can be potentially reduced when fishers are empowered to enforce management within their fishing grounds. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","Efficiently enforcing artisanal fisheries to protect estuarine biodiversity","Ecological Society of America",True,"2018"
"85085775562","The ""pseudo-sticking and pull"", also nicknamed ""blocky effect"" (because of its general aspect), is a common acquisition artifact that reduces considerably the quality of wireline acoustic and microresistive image logs, even though it is not well known among image log interpreters, well-site geologists and engineers. This artifact is generated by heave motion influence when the wave movement is not minimized enough by the compensation systems during offshore wireline operations. In fact, it is well known that the linear or rotary compensator systems reduce the heave variance between 52-80% and, sometimes, other factors such as string weight and fluid density can affect, significantly, wireline logs quality by the heave variance not well compensated. In this case, mainly the wireline stationary tools and the ones that need lower acquisition speed, present depth uncertainties that may cause relevant problems. The image logs are largely used in pre-salt reservoirs for geomechanics, petrophysics, structural, sedimentological and stratigraphic studies due to their great contrast responses on carbonates. However, because acoustic image logs run at speeds around 425 ft/h (against 3600 ft/h from basic logs) and acquire between 180 and 250 samples data each 0,2 inches depth, this log becomes more affected by this artifact than the microresistive one (over 1500 ft/h). The residual heave affects directly the image quality by creating ""pseudo-sticking and pull"" at each wave period, distorting the image log significantly. Besides the artifact that immediately appears on the image during the logging, the residual heave can also be confirmed by observing when cable tension and vector Z accelerometer variation have the same frequency as the period of ocean waves, monitored by the meteo-oceanographic daily reports. Even though this artifact can be minimized with processing (better than true sticking and pull corrections), the loss of quality should be considered. Petrobras experience has also shown that interventions directly on the source by adjusting compensators and changing steering towards can be effective to handle this problem. In order to help the interested community in acquiring better data with minimum costs, this work shows some examples of this artifact on acoustic image logs from pre-salt wells. It can also show the results with processing, the differences reached after adjusting compensators and demands for future works. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Pseudo-sticking and pull - A new old artifact on image logs acquired in ocean wireline log operations","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"85027401053","Todos os Santos Bay (BTS) is the 2nd largest bay in Brazil and an important resource for the people of the State of Bahia. We made measurements of radon and radium in selected areas of the bay to evaluate if these tracers could provide estimates of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and flushing times of the Paraguaçu Estuary and BTS. We found that there were a few areas along the eastern and northeastern shorelines that displayed relatively high radon and low salinities, indicating possible sites of enhanced SGD. A time-series mooring over a tidal cycle at Marina do Bonfim showed a systematic enrichment of the short-lived radium isotopes 223Ra and 224Ra during the falling tide. Assuming that the elevated radium isotopes were related to SGD and using measured radium activities from a shallow well at the site, we estimated groundwater seepage at about 70 m3/day per unit width of shoreline. Extrapolating to an estimated total shoreline length provided a first approximation of total (fresh + saline) SGD into BTS of 300 m3/s, about 3 times the average river discharge into the bay. Just applying the shoreline lengths from areas identified with high radon and reduced salinity results in a lower SGD estimate of 20 m3/s. Flushing times of the Paraguaçu Estuary were estimated at about 3–4 days based on changing radium isotope ratios from low to high salinities. The flushing time for the entire BTS was also attempted using the same approach and resulted in a surprisingly low value of only 6–8 days. Although physical oceanographic models have proposed flushing times on the order of months, a simple tidal prism calculation provided results in the range of 4–7 days, consistent with the radium approach. Based on these initial results, we recommend a strategy for refining both SGD and flushing time estimates. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Applications of radon and radium isotopes to determine submarine groundwater discharge and flushing times in Todos os Santos Bay, Brazil","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2017"
"85089527352","Ports link world commerce via maritime routes, and dredging services are essential to establish and maintain these connections. However, one question is critical when dredging is being considered: where are the best places to do it? To try to answer this question, a Dredging Sensitivity Index (DSI) was developed as a management tool to be used in project planning steps. In order to diminish environmental damages and quality-of-life losses, DSI provides alternatives by identifying sensitivity areas. This new methodology quantifies impacts caused by the sediment removal step and points out favorable areas to dredge, with a simple map. Parameters such as fine-grain content (% < 63 μm), Acid Volatile Sulfides (AVS), Shannon-Wiener Index and fisheries, among others, were used to calculate the DSI. Formulas were used to weight and aggregate both, the parameters and the DSI itself. Sepetiba Bay was chosen to apply this methodology because of its relevant economic and environmental aspects. The methodology was applied to dredging situations, but it can be used to indicate areas for dredged material disposal, with a few modifications in the DSI formulas. A DSI map was a final result of this methodology, and showed that the northern portion of the bay, close to the littoral is a more sensitive area, where dredging should be avoided, or carried out very carefully. DSI is a very useful tool for reducing damages from dredging services, it contributes with zonation and it provides alternatives to decision-makers who manage these areas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Development of a Dredging Sensitivity Index, applied to an industrialized coastal environment in Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2020"
"84944593501","Nowadays no other region on earth is more threatened by natural hazards than coastal areas. However the increasing risk in this area is not just a climate extreme events’ result. Coasts are the places with highest concentration of people and values, thus impacts continue to increase as the values of coastal infrastructures continue to grow. Climate change aggravates chronic social vulnerabilities since social groups may be affected differently both by climate change as well as by risk management actions. Relationships between these groups are often characterized by inequality, with different perceptions, response, or adaptation modes to climate hazards. Misperception of these differences often leads to policies that deepen inequities and increase the vulnerability of the weakest groups. Population affected by climatic extreme events increases dramatically resulting in urgent adaptation intervention. We address the interdependence of risk perception and vulnerability of coastal communities and the relevance of ecosystem services for adaptation. We developed a methodology where risk analysis and communities’ risk perception are linked through key actions at strategic points of risk assessment: (i) initial interviews with qualified local informants to complete an inventory of ecosystem services, (ii) a social valuation of ecosystem services by local people, and (iii) assessment of stakeholders’ social vulnerability. This approach allows a truly socially weighted risk assessment to be validated in three sites: Valle de Itajai (Brazil), Estuary of Lagoa dos Patos (Brazil), and Laguna de Rocha (Uruguay). In this novel approach, risk assessment is forced by social perceptions, thus risk treatment can better contribute to realistic adaptation arrangements to cope with climate forces.

The focus area of this study corresponds to a belt in the offshore portion of the Potiguar Basin, which runs parallel to the shoreline, about 40 km from it. The carbonate rocks of the Ponta do Mel Formation date from the Late Albian and, similar to what occurs in the other basins of the Brazilian continental margin, their deposition is related to the separation events of the African and South American continents. In the stratigraphic analysis of the wells (1D analysis), it was possible to characterize carbonate lithofacies, that are the predominant, as well as mixed and siliciclastic lithofacies. It was also possible to individualize shallowing upward cycles and cycle sets, which were associated with the identified systems tracts. In the seismic stratigraphic analysis, in the same way, four seismic facies were visualized, which, in general, are related to the tractive processes involved in the deposition of the carbonate, mixed and siliciclastic lithofacies, defined in the 1D analysis. The integration of the results from the well data analysis to the seismic stratigraphic analysis allowed to understand that the studied interval, which coincides, in lithostratigraphic terms, with the Ponta do Mel Formation, represents a complete depositional sequence, here referred to as the Albian-Cenomanian Sequence, formed by the Lowstand Systems Tract (LST), Transgressive Systems Tract (TST), and Highstand Systems Tract (HST).

Since first oil in 2009, a unique method of subsea separation and boosting has been deployed on BC-10, utilizing vertical caisson separators with Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP's) to pump well fluids from up to 2000m water depth to the FPSO facility.

"85103724572","Polymer flooding is a chemical enhanced oil recovery that aims to improve mobility control, by increasing the viscosity of injection brine and thus reducing the mobility ratio. Starting the polymer injection as early as possible brings the best economic results because it prevents the formation of viscous fingering and sweeps more efficiently the reservoir. It is possible, however, to obtain gains with polymer flooding even after massive waterfloods. In this work, three different model-based approaches are developed to revitalize mature oilfields and tested considering the use of water and polymer as injection fluid. These strategies were tested using a synthetic reservoir model based on data from an offshore field in Brazil. The reservoir is sandstone (average permeability = 1650mD, average porosity = 20%). The oleic phase is heavy viscous oil (~70 cP, 14° API). The first simulation approach considered a strategy based on a standard waterflood until its economic limit. For this case, the maximum net present value (NPV) was reached after 15 years of production with a recovery factor of 25%. The revitalization strategy of this field considers an abandonment status for all wells. To emulate the time necessary to install all new facilities, all wells were assumed to be closed for six months. The first approach consists simply of reopening the injectors by changing the injection fluid to an aqueous polymer solution. The second approach has an additional degree of freedom: it allows all wells to be converted from injectors to producers and vice-versa. Finally, the third approach consists of the addition of new wells. Equations for quality maps for placing injectors and producers are presented. Using these equations, new producers and injectors could be placed at the best locations to produce the remaining oil spots. All three approaches increased the oil recovery factor. The additional oil recovery and variations in NPV were higher for the polymer flooding when compared with the standard waterflood, ensuring a longer productive life. This significant increase in oil production means that, for the selected case, producers needed to be closed in the water flooding period, due to economic performance, leaving a significant amount of oil still in the reservoir. The methodologies presented in this paper are easy to apply and can allow mature fields to economically produce more oil. The conversion of old wells by changing from producers to injectors or vice-versa allows new and creative production strategies. This can be done in onshore and dry completed offshore fields demanding small budgets and intervention times. This paper shows that it is possible to increase both the recovery factor and net present value of fields in the later stages of production life. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Application of polymer flooding in the revitalization of a mature heavy oil field","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2021"

This paper argues that the influence of power disconnects delayed the proper actions. Power disconnects occur when the victims of environmental harm (residents of northeastern and southeastern Brazil) lack power to prevent it or, conversely, when those who do have the power to protect the environment (the Brazilian government and the international community) do not experience the costs of degradation. Although Brazil has emerged as an environmental leader in the international arena in the past, it has fallen behind on the improvements that are needed to prevent spills like this from affecting coastal communities and biodiversity in the future.

"85044530973","The Campos basin is a sedimentary basin located in offshore Brazil, between the north coast of Rio de Janeiro State and the south coast of Espírito Santo State, encompassing many oilfields. Most of the reservoirs in the basin are high-permeability sandstones containing low API gravity oil but are without strong water drives. Long horizontal producer wells are the best economic option for field development but require water injection to maintain reservoir pressure. Horizontal sections generally range from 1000 to 2000m, which demands gravel pack as a sand control method. Gravel packing such long wells is a challenge and requires thoughtful engineering to optimize pumping techniques and technology. Presented here are best practices to overcome several challenges faced in this field to achieve overall success. The challenge for extended-reach gravel packing is that the long horizontal section develops high friction during the alpha and beta wave propagation. Increasing the pumping pressure to overcome this friction increases the risk of fracturing the formation, consequently reducing the equivalent circulation rate downhole impairing the proppant transportation. In contrast, a reduced pump rate during alpha wave propagation can lead to a premature screenout due to the increase in dune height of over 85%. To overcome these issues and place gravel packs in these wells, careful engineering and simulation, lightweight proppants, friction reducers, and thorough job planning were used to successfully perform gravel packs in more than 40 horizontal wells completed in the Campos basin from 2011 up to 2017. The experience of pumping the longest gravel pack jobs in offshore Brazil (horizontal length more than 2,000m) offer insights into best practices for gravel packs in extended-reach horizontal wells: Design considerations, specific well challenges faced, technologies deployed, and operational planning requirements. Specifically, highlighting the benefits of using lightweight proppants and optimized fluid systems to minimize screen out risks and maximize pack efficiency.

"85085778850","This work explains the process of how a bit was designed specifically to address drilling challenges of the reservoir section of the Mero Field offshore Brazil. The performance of this new bit is compared to previous bits used in the field. A systematic process to design and evaluate the performance of a new bit involves interaction with the operator to understand the challenges and gather information, evaluate previous bit performances, use software to simulate the new bit design based on drilling conditions in the field, manufacture the bit according to design specifications, run the bit according to planned parameters, capture and report results, and evaluate results to identify possible improvements. The reservoir section has a high hardness and is primarily composed of calcareous rock and silica intercalations. Since the discovery of the Mero Field, more than 17 wells have been drilled by different companies. In the majority of the wells, the reservoir section was drilled using impregnated bits and turbines. As a result, the application of a systematic process was used to solve operator challenges where a new bit was designed and run in the field to drill the reservoir section of two wells. A comparison was performed between the previous bits used in the field and the new bit concept, certifying that the new bit reduced the reservoir section drilling time by 59%. This work discusses improved drilling efficiency in the reservoir section by drilling with a new bit design in a field where only impregnated bits and turbines were used.

"85091197319","On the account of the absence of modern analogues, the interpretation of evaporite-bearing basins relies extensively on seismic and well data. Recent studies describe the intrasalt kinematic, geometries and compositions, relating the change of reflection patterns in seismic data to variations in evaporite sequences. However, these interpretations are only qualitative. This study describes a step further in proceeding from qualitative to quantitative interpretation of an evaporite-dominated interval. It integrates geophysical and geological foundations by combining rock physics, seismic inversion and statistical techniques to deliver seismic-driven facies volume of the evaporite sequence in the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. Synthetic seismogram demonstrate the ambiguities and uncertainties in relating the seismic amplitude to salt types. Rock-physics analysis indicates that acoustic impedance is an effective differentiator of salt types in comparison to seismic amplitude. Therefore, we perform seismic inversion to transform interface property into layer property. The acoustic impedance volume mitigated significantly the risk of seismic interpretation in the salt sequence. The Bayesian classification integrates acoustic impedance and rock-physics analysis to deliver the seismic-driven facies volume, which categorizes bittern salts, halite and anhydrite. This enables the refinement of the seismic-stratigraphic interpretation of intrasalt sequences of the Ariri Formation based on the sedimentary cycles of evaporites. Additionally, we calculate proportion maps to evaluate the spatial variability of salt deposition. We observe an increase in bittern salts and anhydrite proportions from the bottom to the top of the sequence. The comparison between well-based and seismic-based proportions testifies to the quantitative potential of seismic data.

"85056110569","Significant volumes of heavy and high viscosity oil have been discovered in the Campos and Santos Basins, offshore Brazil, and its economical production is a challenge for the oil industry. New production technologies are required for the economic development of offshore heavy oil reservoirs. Long horizontal or multilateral wells, produced with high power ESPs, hydraulic pumps or submarine multiphase pumps, could partially compensate the decrease in productivity caused by the high oil viscosity. The flow assurance could be improved with insulated or heated flowlines or, alternatively, with the use of water as the continuous phase. The heavy oil processing in a Floating Production Unit is not straightforward, and new separation technologies, as well as the feasibility of the heavy oil transportation with emulsified water, should be investigated. The existence of light oil reserves in neighboring reservoirs, even in small volumes, would be an important issue for the commercial feasibility of the heavy oil area. The Petrobras experience with offshore heavy oil fields in the Campos Basin shows that some can be economically produced. However, the economic feasibility is controlled by factors such as: reservoir characteristics; water depth; possibility of blend with light oil; oil acidity and contaminants; price scenario; fiscal regime; availability of new production technologies; transportation, refining and marketability of the heavy oil. The recently created Petrobras Heavy Oil Technological Program - PROPES - is in charge of the development, together with universities, service companies and the industry, of new technologies for the offshore heavy oil fields. The main objective of all this work is to set the basis for the economical development of the significant volumes of heavy oil already discovered offshore Brazil.

"84897399429","Petroleum exploration along the West African and South American Equatorial Margin has led to important oil discoveries along both margins. Similar geochemical characteristics of these finds suggest analogous petroleum systems with enormous potential in the conjugate margin sedimentary basins. The Jubilee giant oil discovery offshore Ghana has an estimated recoverable reserve of about 600 million barrels. In the area that was once connected to the equatorial West African margin, but is now separated by the Atlantic Ocean, two discoveries have recently been announced. Tullow Oil announced the Zaedyus discovery offshore French Guinea, with 72m net oil pay in turbidite sandstones. Petrobras and BP announced the Pecem discovery in the northern Brazilian margin, with 140m of net pay in 2,129m water depth in the Ceara Basin. These discoveries appear to have a very similar geologic evolution, source rock facies, and oil types suggesting similar petroleum systems. Additionally, the integration of high resolution geochemical data from oils recovered from boreholes offshore the other basins along the South Atlantic Equatorial Margin has revealed four separate source rock systems: 1- an Aptian/Barremian calcareous black shale associated with a lacustrine brackish to saline anoxic environment; 2- a Late Aptian calcareous shale deposited in transitional environments, as indicated by oils found in the Ceará and Potiguar basins; 3- an Albian/Cenomanian/ Turonian marine shale corresponding to an anoxic event widespread in the West African salt basins, particularly in the deep water settings of the Ghana and Angola continental margins. Similar oils have also been registered in the Foz do Amazonas Pará-Maranhão basins and in five ultra-deep water accumulations discovered recently (2011-2012) in the Sergipe Basin; 4- Paleocene-Eocene shales deposited in deltaic environments in the Niger Delta, the Amazon Cone, and Pará-Maranhão Basin. This work aims to restore these basins to their previous pre-breakup locations and to support new exploration efforts. Despite similarities shown above, simply matching discoveries in the conjugate margin basins, for example the Tano Basin offshore Ghana, with the Ceará Basin in northern Brazil, does not necessarily yield the entire story that may lead to a successful end. There is a great deal of contrasting sedimentary and structural development peculiarities from basin to basin and margin to margin.

In this study, Crassostrea gasar oysters were transplanted and maintained for seven days at three sites (S1, S2, and S3) in the Laguna Estuarine System (LES)—situated in southern Brazil—that has been exposed to multiple anthropic stresses. On the basis of the concentrations of metal and organic pollutants in oysters, we identified marked spatial variations in pollutant levels, with S3 showing the highest concentration of Ag, Fe, Ni, Zn, and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and linear alkylbenzenes (LABs), followed by S2 and S1. Along with the concentrations of pollutants, a set of biomarkers was analyzed. Oysters maintained at S3 showed enhanced protective defenses in gills, as observed by the increased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD-like) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90-like) transcripts and catalase (CAT) activity, concomitant with reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels. Decreased antioxidant activities together with increased MDA levels are indicative of the digestive gland being more susceptible to pollutant-induced oxidative damage. Oysters transplanted into LES showed lower levels of cytochrome P450 transcripts (CYP356A1-like and CYP2AU1), and decreased glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzyme activity, suggesting lower biotransformation capacity.

"84904394721","During the exploratory phase, Petrobras traditionally performs extended well tests (EWT) in deepwater reservoirs. In offshore environments these extended well tests (EWT) are performed by ships that are able to store the produced oil in cargo tanks for subsequent offloading. In pursuit of a more environmentally friendly alternative, PETROBRAS has researched gas to liquid (GTL) technology, which converts natural gas into synthetic crude oil that can be mixed with the produced oil for storage and offloading. Numerical simulations were carried out taking into account a pre-reforming, steam methane reforming and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis section via a steady state refining process simulator called PETROX developed by Petrobras. Two single trains of natural gas feed containing CO2 were considered. CO2 was consumed in the steam methane reactor to form CO as a consequence of equilibrium change in the steam methane and water-gas-shift reactions. Nevertheless, the GTL overall process cannot be considered a CO2 sequestration process yet, since the net CO2 process balance is positive. The results show that there are optimization opportunities to develop pre-reformer catalysts less selective to CO2 production and reformer catalysts capable of increasing the dry reforming reaction extension with no coke formation. In addition, changes in the process can be done to replace natural gas by hydrogen in the reformer combustion to increase the overall carbon efficiency and reduce the CO2 emission. The observed reduction in the overall syncrude production with high CO2 content is acceptable to the EWT scenario.

Data were obtained for two sectors: 1) Halimeda Bank (HB), inner shelf (−12 m), and 2) transverse profile (TP), inner to outer shelf-upper slope (−5 to −100 m). In total, 72 samples were collected, and 29 km of seismic lines (HB) and ROV profiles (HB and TP) were surveyed. The main chemical elements were Ca and Si (93%). These elements occur in two types of shallow marine sediments: carbonate (mainly autochthonous) and siliciclastics (terrigenous/allochthonous/relict). With respect to the chemical elements, a strong negative correlation was observed between calcareous (Ca and Sr) and siliciclastic (Si, Al, and K) components. Strontium does not always show a strong positive correlation with Ca. The average CaCO3 contents of 81% and 91% were determined for the HB and TP, respectively. The profiles show a predominance of carbonate sediments; however, the HB demonstrates a greater continental influence (inner shelf). The grain size presents a prevalence of sand (82%) in relation to gravel (18%). This particle size variation is mainly due to the breakdown of Halimeda nodules, siliciclastic sediments in the finer fraction (&gt;2.5Φ), and the presence of gravel with iron coating (relict). Two types of echo-characters have been identified. Both are associated with the large presence of carbonate sediments. Echo I shows the bottom surface with continuity in the sub-bottom without a subsurface reflector. Echo II presents a discontinuous subsurface reflector. The ROV allowed the observation of algae patches in higher floors and gravelly and sandy bioclastics in the lowest sectors. Large patches of calcareous green algae, Halimeda, occur in the inner shelf below the 15 m isobath, mainly due to the semi-arid climate (weak sediment supply from the mainland), geographical position (equatorial) and oceanographic conditions (hydrodynamic and biogeochemistry). It has been concluded that the seafloor of the semi-arid continental shelf of East Ceará (NE Brazil) shows modern predominance of carbonate deposition based on the lack of contaminants, geochemical purity of carbonate sediments, and high percentage of CaCO3. The conditions for exploitation in the intermediate sector are provided. However, it would be ideal to perform punctual extraction and analyze the resilience and regeneration of Halimeda incrassata and the consequences for fisheries (important economic resource of the region). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Modern and relict sedimentary systems of the semi-arid continental shelf in NE Brazil","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2018"

"85077945350","This study presents new stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from Lower Cretaceous lacustrine carbonate rock samples recovered from a well drilled in the Santos Basin, offshore southeast Brazil. These samples represent a record of a continental environment just prior to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean and the ultimate break-up of Gondwanaland. The geochemical data, along with carbonate mineralogy, indicate repeated cycles of lake level variation that could be attributed to climatic oscillations. Despite the absence of correlations between δ13C and δ18O values, facies analysis and the isotopic and mineralogical data suggest that lake hydrology was essentially closed for most of the depositional interval studied here. The existence of persisting trends of nearly constant δ13C values with a spread in δ18O values though, suggests long water residence times in the palaeolake, equilibrium between atmosphere and lake water CO2, as well as significant evaporation of water. The overall geological model that emerges unveils a more comprehensive picture of the depositional conditions that favoured the continuity of a significant carbonate factory in the middle of the Gondwanan continent, corroborating previous studies that suggested the lasting existence of a large and somewhat shallow endorheic lake in the area during the Early Cretaceous. As a result of this recorded trend strongly suggesting equilibrium between lake waters DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) reservoir and atmospheric CO2, the data are most consistent with lacustrine deposition rather than precipitation of travertine, contrasting with some suggestions for the genesis of the carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation. Finally, this apparent equilibrium with the atmosphere likely left a preserved record in the continental carbonates of the final stages that preceded a major global environmental disturbance associated with an increase in atmospheric CO2, known for this time as the Oceanic Anoxic Event (OAE) 1a. If this is correct, it also helps to put further time constraints on this studied interval, which should not be younger than Barremian age, and to provide a regional continental perspective on a global event. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental conditions of deposition of the Lower Cretaceous lacustrine carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation, Santos Basin (Brazil), based on stable carbon and oxygen isotopes: A continental record of pCO2 during the onset of the Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a) interval?","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2020"

"50249181836","Built in China for 2006 startup, the SSP30 FPSO offshore platform is the first circular platform built in the world. It has been sent to Brazil to operate in the Piranema field, 37 km from the city of Aracaju, Sergipe state, northeastern Brazil. It can extract up to 30,000 bbl/day of 43-44 degree API light crude oil and can store 300,000 bbl. It will operate in 1,000-1,600 m of water. The circular geometry, known as mono-column, has a double casing. It was developed by the Centro de Investigaciones y Desarrollo de Petrobras (Cenpes) within an Agreement of Technological Cooperation. This agreement searches for alternatives in the development of double hull projects for larger platforms for its various projects in Brazil and elsewhere. The advantage of this structure is the flexibility that its operation affords. It can be withdrawn and used on other small fields and used to make tests of long duration. The platforms of low transport charges, like the SSP300, are a good option to reduce the cost of development of small accumulations of crude oil in deep water. The double hull was built at the Yantai-Raffles shipyard in China, then transported to The Netherlands, where a processing and production plant for crude oil and gas was installed. This FPSO belongs to the Norwegian company Sevan Production AS. The FPSO is expected to reach Brazil at the end of October 2006 and in 2007 to connect to six wells of maximum 1,450 m depth. The Piranema project is strategic to Petrobras to increase production of Brazilian light crude oil as an objective of the company business plan to create a primary pole of production in deep water in the Brazilian northeast. To develop the Aracaju field will require $(US)/750 million.

"77955408815","This paper shows work performed through a Joint Industry Project (JIP), aimed to enable repairs made from composite materials to be applied to metallic structural components of offshore platforms in general and FPSOs in particular. The basic motivation was to provide a repair methodology that would cause a reduced impact to platform operations, particularly in classified areas. The focus on FPSOs derived from the fact that most of them are converted tankers, originally designed for overhauling in suitable docks from time to time. That is no longer possible once they are deployed as floating platforms, intended to stay in place for twenty years or more. An important prerequisite was that the repair procedure had necessarily to have the approval of the Classification Society of the platform. The project was conducted in three phases. The objective of the first phase was to develop a qualification procedure for the repair of relevant defects with adhesive patches and to demonstrate its feasibility with simple examples. Along phase two a Project Recommended Practice for Patch Repair was issued and more qualification tests were performed. Phase three consisted of a practical application of the Recommended Practice, accomplished within Petrobras by a repair at a ballast tank of the production semisubmersible platform P-20, in operation at Campos basin. The repair was accomplished by means of carbon fiber reinforcements within a vinylester matrix. This paper describes the P-20 repair case and the design of the bonded repair. A brief overview is presented of the installation of the repair, quality assurance issues and needs for future follow-up. The experimental and theoretical studies performed in support of the repair trial are briefly described.

"84897392529","Deep-water exploration in Brazil has continued to increase in complexity, requiring new technology to not only meet the ever increasing demands of the challenging environments but also the increase in costs. These have been incurred from the continuous increase and upgrades in safety regulations and the costs associated with exploration into new environments. In this scenario, operators are welcoming any cost-effective methods to evaluate well profitability without sacrificing safety. In a newly discovered potential oil block, it is necessary to obtain downhole data such as pressure, temperature under specific conditions (flow and build-up periods) as well as obtain pressure-compensated fluid samples and produced volume across time. To obtain these data, it is necessary to perform Drill-Stem Tests (DSTs). Using the type of data that can be derived from DSTs, it is possible to estimate the volume of the reservoir, its layers inside the tested field, and other characteristics that are necessary for planning completion. If performed offshore, testing requires safety equipment placed inside the blowout preventer (BOP) stack to keep the well under control, prevent undesired flow, and protect the environment and personnel. Recent discoveries in Brazil indicate that there is a large hydrocarbon potential in the pre-salt area. That area extends in a track that includes 800 kilometers from the northeast to the southern regions, is 200 kilometers wide away from the coast, and has reservoirs that are 3,000 meters deep. The initial estimation of hydrocarbon production for the Brazilian pre-salt area was approximately 60 billion barrels, but other research has shown different results that are estimated to be from 120 to 200 billion barrels. The importance of this information has more than justified the need to perform DST operations to obtain reliable data. According to Petrobras, Brazilian production has increased steadily, and production has been 300 thousand barrels/day since 2008, when pre-salt production in Brazil commenced; the company wants to reach 1 million barrels/day by 2017. To achieve those numbers, it will be necessary to guarantee that the reservoir will respond as originally predicted. This will require acquisition of reliable data to estimate the current resources, which the DST provides. After the DST, if the operator determines that the production from the formation has not performed according to their expectation or their desired production rate, then the operator may choose to fracture the well. This process is performed by injecting large amounts of a specific, proppant-laden fluid into the reservoir at a high pressures and high pump rates, in order to attempt to increase the reservoir's expected production. With the traditionally used equipment, after completing the fracturing process, the equipment must be pulled out of the hole (POOH) and tripped in again to perform the actual drill-stem testing operation. Several trips were required, because the safety equipment available for the oil industry was not certified to work in extreme environments with solids being pumped at high rates and pressures. If the trips were to be consolidated, a specially-designed downhole equipment package would have to be developed. A major engineering/service company has now developed new subsea safety-tree equipment to be placed inside the BOP stack; with this new equipment, the fracturing operation and the drill-stem testing can be performed in the same trip, since the safety valve system has the capability to maintain integrity when functioning in heavy proppant, high pressure, and high pump-rate conditions. This new equipment was qualified for the conditions to which it was expected to be subjected by testing the material behavior under fracturing pressures of up to 13000 psi with 23 bbl/min pumping rate with slurry that had 6 lbm of sand per gallon. After over 350,000 lbm of sand proppant fluid was flowed through the subsea safety tree, and it was closed for 5 minutes at full sand-concentration slurry. Afterwards, the pressure was increased to 15000 psi for 10 minutes with no leakage across the tree. After being disassembled, the new subsea safety tree was inspected; the inspection showed minimal damage and erosion on the inside walls of the tool, indicating that the equipment would qualify for this type of offshore operation.

That workflow comprises a reservoir and flow assurance simulators, achieving more accurate responses compared to regular workflows.

We evaluated two petroelastic models to obtain the acoustic impedance (AI) and shear impedance (SI) needed to estimate potential time-lapse differences (ΔAI, ΔSI, and ΔVP/VS). For this, we used the Gassmann and Xu-Payne models, in which the latter considers the pore geometry of the rock in its equations. Our analysis of both models shows that changes in pressure and saturation are very similar, and we can conclude that, despite being a carbonate, the application of Gassmann's model is sufficient for the 4D feasibility studies conducted in the deemed reservoir because it does not require pore space geometry parameters, as does the Xu-Payne model. The analysis of the time-lapse attributes provided us with a greater comprehension of the 4D scenarios modeled, some of which presented detectability of changes in the microbialite and coquina. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","4D petroelastic modeling based on a presalt well","Society of Exploration Geophysicists",True,"2020"
"85060443361","Currently, the Port of Santos is the largest in Latin America, and its access channel is in the process of deepening, intending to reach 17 m DHN as an ultimate goal. Specifically for the maritime bar section, which is now maintained only by dredging, a significant increase in the volume of maintenance dredging is expected. The current study applied the physical modelling to evaluate the effectiveness of two curved jetties in the maintenance of depth along the inlet entrance of Santos channel, its impact on the dispersion of the plume of effluents from the existing outfall and its influence on the beach adjacent to the proposed right jetty. As a result, the jetties’ layout could maintain the access channel’s depth with a much lower volume of dredging than the current maintenance requires. It was found that the increase of 1.2 km on the outfall’s original length would not only reduce the influence of the jetties’ presence, but also improve significantly the dispersion of effluents in comparison to the original situation. Moreover, the presence of the jetties induces a marine accretion that tends to protect the region adjacent to the inlet, which is currently suffering a severe erosion process.

"85090507698","The present study aims to propose a methodology to treat probabilistically the prediction of well bottom pressures during drilling, circulation and tripping operations. The pressure generated by the fluid is the primary safety barrier and its failure can immediately initiate gains and losses events in the well, with a direct impact on the safety of the process. Two models were considered in the study: a two-phase flow model commonly used to predict hole cleaning and downhole pressures while drilling and a pressure propagation single flow transient model (which considers fluid compressibility and gelation) to account for peaks in tripping and pump restarts. A Monte Carlo method coupled with a latin hypercube strategy was implemented to propagate the uncertainties in the input variables to the resulting pressure. The probabilistic approach aims to consider the uncertainties in the input variables (weight, rheology, penetration rate, drillstring velocity and acceleration, pump flow, particle diameter, well trajectory, etc.). Monte Carlo Simulation was conducted to generate the pressure distribution curves in each of the operations: drilling, circulation, tripping and pump restarts. Probabilistic pressures are fit into probabilistic operational windows allowing the quantification of the risk of losing the barrier.

"85101359309","The characterization of geological faults from geological and geophysical data is often subject to uncertainties, owing to data ambiguity and incomplete spatial coverage. We propose a stochastic sampling algorithm which generates fault network scenarios compatible with sparse fault evidence while honoring some geological concepts. This process is useful for reducing interpretation bias, formalizing interpretation concepts, and assessing first-order structural uncertainties. Each scenario is represented by an undirected association graph, where a fault corresponds to an isolated clique, which associates pieces of fault evidence represented as graph nodes. The simulation algorithm samples this association graph from the set of edges linking the pieces of fault evidence that may be interpreted as part of the same fault. Each edge carries a likelihood that the endpoints belong to the same fault surface, expressing some general and regional geological interpretation concepts. The algorithm is illustrated on several incomplete data sets made of three to six two-dimensional seismic lines extracted from a three-dimensional seismic image located in the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. In all cases, the simulation method generates a large number of plausible fault networks, even when using restrictive interpretation rules. The case study experimentally confirms that retrieving the reference association is difficult due to the problem combinatorics. Restrictive and consistent rules increase the likelihood to recover the reference interpretation and reduce the diversity of the obtained realizations.

Despite the relatively low levels of pollutants and no evidence of negative effects based on guideline levels, sediments collected close to harbors were enriched with CYP1A-inducing agents and they showed higher cytotoxicity. In contrast, sediments from internal areas inhibited CYP19 activity, which suggests the presence of endocrine disrupters at these sites.

In the studied well, from Santos basin, Brazil, it was possible to identify several kinds of subaerial basaltic lava flow units, such as compound pahoehoe, sheet pahoehoe and rubbly pahoehoe lava flows. Vesicles, amygdales, vesicle cylinders, sub-horizontal vesicle sheets, autobreccias and entablature are some of the structures described in this study. As a result, 2 image catalogues of subaerial volcanic rocks were produced characterizing facies and flow units along with a stratigraphic model of the history of this volcanism. This is the first time that pahoehoe lava flow units could be characterized at an offshore Brazilian basin. The results achieved are important for the understanding of the Cretaceous volcanism events in the pre-salt layer and also provide support for the evaluation and geological modelling of the volcanic rocks in Santos Basin oil fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Characterization of subaerial volcanic facies using acoustic image logs: Lithofacies and log-facies of a lava-flow deposit in the Brazilian pre-salt, deepwater of Santos Basin","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2019"
"85051653660","The use of a high quality mud is an essential requirement to guarantee a successful drilling operation. The drilling industry aims to build wells at low costs and as fast as possible. Among other drilling problems, an adequately formulated drilling fluid will prevent wellbore instability while contributing to generate an in gauge borehole. Usually, one of the desired properties of a drilling mud is the least as possible interaction with the drilled formation. On the other hand, the idea of a chemically active fluid that would react with the rock to help improving drilling performance is very welcome. This kind of fluid should not only mitigate drilling problems but also contribute for the improvement of the overall process. The work presents the advances in drilling fluid technology to overcome the challenges that have arisen with the discovery of Pre Salt offshore Brazil, specially the drilling of long salt section containing highly soluble salt layers and the low penetration rates in hard carbonate rocks. An extensive theoretical and experimental work was carried out to assist drilling fluid design in this drilling scenario. A special fluid formulation developed to interact with carbonate rocks and increase penetration rate is presented. Although some important issues have yet to be addressed, the preliminary results show a good potential for the new technology.

"85067965170","The Brazilian oceanic islands are privileged places for studying unique landforms, evolved under an active tectonic setting, and humid to semi-arid climates of marine influence. The main landform aspects of the two main islands (Fernando de Noronha and Trindade) are presented, showing the importance of volcanic activity at hot spots, with older events in Noronha, resulting in extensive weathering and erosion of the less resistant rocks (tuffs, scoria), compared with prominent phonolite massive stocks, forming exhumed pinnacles and domes of structural resistance. In contrast, Late Quaternary volcanism at Trindade resulted in the preservation of younger volcanic features, such as caldera remains, volcanic platforms and slopes, lava and scoria fields, and dark-sand beaches formed by high contents of primary mineral such as magnetite. Storm beaches composed of large clasts (cobbles) are also found in both islands. Trindade and Noronha islands show polyphasic aeolian features at some coastal sectors, with sand dunes of bioclastic carbonates, with greater extension in Noronha compared with Trindade. Uplifted marine terraces are found in both islands, associated with former high sea levels. In contrast, the presence of submerged terraces at Noronha and Trindade is related to a combination of glacio-eustatic variations (low sea levels) and epeirogenic uplift. In Noronha (Rata Island), we can find a rare case of oceanic karst landscape developed on calcareous sandstone, with abundant lapiez and dissolution features. Also, ornithogenic soils are widespread, with great importance for paleoecological studies of former bird colonies in these isolated islands. The most prominent landforms are structural and tectonically controlled, and the erosion degree in Noronha advanced much farther than in Trindade, exhuming pre-existent volcanic necks and similar structures, forming a complex and impressive landform scenery. Trindade reveals unique, endemic landscapes formed by pure stands of arboreal ferns (Cyathea sp.), where deep organic soils developed. Fluvial erosion is very limited, but there is evidence of a former greater importance of run-off in Noronha and Trindade. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Brazil in the South Atlantic: The Fernando de Noronha and Trindade Archipelagos","Springer",True,"2015"
"84891344152","This long-term study, performed during the years 2003-2005 and 2008-2009, investigated the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents of the phyto-and zooplankton communities and the nutrient regime of Cabo Frio Bay, SE Brazil. The information intends to serve as baseline of the plankton C, N, and P stoichiometry for the calibration of biogeochemical and ecological models in support to future findings related to the local and regional phenomena of climatic change. Cabo Frio Bay is a small semienclosed system set adjacent to a region subject to sporadic coastal upwelling. Zooplankton exhibited average annual C, N, and P contents of 11.6 ± 6.9 %, 2.8 ± 1.8 %, and 0.18 ± 0.08 %, and phytoplankton (>20 μm) 6.8 ± 6.0 %, 1.6 ± 1.5 %, and 0.09 ± 0.08 %, respectively. The C/N/P ratios correspond to the lowest already found to date for a marine environment. The low C contents must have been brought about by a predominance of gelatinous zooplankton, like Doliolids/Salps and also Pteropods. Average annual nutrient concentrations in the water were 0.21 ± 0.1 μM for phosphate, 0.08 ± 0.1 μM for nitrite, 0.74 ± 1.6 μM for nitrate, and 1.27 ± 1.1 μM for ammonium. N/P ratios were around 8:1 during the first study period and 12:1 during the second. The plankton C/N/P and N/P nutrient ratios and elemental concentrations suggest that the system was oligotrophic and nitrogen limited. The sporadic intrusions of upwelling waters during the first study period had no marked effect upon the systems metabolism, likely due to dilution effects and the short residence times of water of the bay. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stoichiometry of plankton and the nutrient regime in Cabo Frio Bay, SE Brazil",NULL,True,"2014"
"82555187024","Large volume semi-submersible units may present significant wave induced resonant motions in heave, roll and pitch. Evaluating the slow motions of such systems is important from the initial stages of their designs and therefore requires a model that is both accurate and expedite enough. In the present article, different options for modeling the second-order hydrodynamic forces and induced motions are discussed using as a case-study the PETROBRAS 52 unit - P-52. Computations of the low frequency forces are performed in the frequency domain by means of a commercial Boundary Element Method (BEM) code. Different hydrodynamic approximations are tested and evaluated by directly comparing the predicted responses with those measured in small-scale tests performed in a wave-basin. From the results obtained in theses comparisons, a methodology based on a white-noise approach of the force spectrum is proposed. The validity of such approximation is attributable to the typically low damping levels in heave, roll and pitch motions. Furthermore, results also indicate that the second order forces may be calculated disregarding the free-surface forcing components, an option that helps to reduce the computational burden even more, rendering the procedure suitable for preliminary design calculations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The density was calculated from the ratio between the total number of eggs and larvae in each sample and the filtered water volume. For spatial interpolation we used the technique of Voronoi polygon. Results showed that in the two sampling periods of the year (rainy season and dry season) were collected 4,934 eggs and fish larvae, and 60% were recorded in the dry season. The location of the largest lchthyoplankton densities vary with the highest concentrations closer to the south-east channel of the CESM in the dry season, moving to the center in the rainy season. The South-East channel of the CESM is therefore a nursery area for many species of fish, requiring priority actions for environmental protection. © 2019 Author(s).","Fish larval distribution in a macro-tidal regime: An in situ study in São Marcos Bay (Brazilian Equatorial Margin)","American Institute of Physics Inc.",True,"2019"

The objective of this study was to identify, and describe the anatomopathological alterations in the stomach of free-living marine turtles found dead on the beaches of the Microrregião dos Lagos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Twenty-two sea turtles were necropsied, and stomach fragments were collected, fixed, and processed routinely. The presence of gastritis, parasitism, and adaptative morphological alteration of the cells were evaluated in a microscopic analysis. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were performed. Of the samples, 59.1% had stomach hyperemia. Microscopically, gastritis was found in 86.4% of cases, parasitism in 72.7%, and adaptive morphological alteration in 59.1%. There was an association between the presence of cellular adaptive morphological alteration and chronic inflammation. This the first report to describe the adaptive morphological changes observed in the stomach cells. The chronicity of the lesions was due to continuous aggressions to the tissue, with parasitism, garbage ingestion, and environmental pollutants as possible causes. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the chronicity of the stomach lesions is due to continuous aggressions to this tissue, and the irritating factors have environmental origin, such as parasites, garbage, and toxic pollutants, including heavy metals, which are ingested by free-living sea turtles. This article demonstrates that stomach injuries in free-living marine turtles are frequent, severe, and possibly underdiagnosed; these lesions reflect the diseased ecosystem in which those animals live. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Gastric lesions in free-living sea turtles: An underestimated disease that reflects the health of the ecosystem","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"
"85044596303","Shelf morphology and sedimentary regimes are influenced by processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales and are important records of sea level changes and sediment supply and/or carbonate production. The northern continental shelf of Espírito Santo (Brazil) contains evidence of different sedimentary regimes that distribute diverse and complex marine habitats. Herein, seabed morphology, acoustic images of the seafloor (side scan sonar and sub-bottom profiler), and sediment samples were used to investigate the influence of sedimentary regimes on physical marine habitat distribution. Seabed mapping is also integrated with available data on fisheries to understand the influence of shelf morphology and sedimentology in the usage of distinct fishing gears. The results indicate five morpho-sedimentary facies: terrigenous mud, terrigenous sand, rhodolith beds, carbonate gravel with rhodoliths, and hardground. Through an integrated analysis of the geomorphology and sedimentary distribution, two morpho-sedimentary domains were identified: a sediment-fed shelf adjacent to the Doce River associated with a major mud depocenter and a delta front morphology characterized by gentle slopes and low terrain ruggedness, and a sediment-starved shelf dominated by carbonate sedimentation showing an irregular morphology associated with higher slopes and terrain ruggedness. These contrasting morpho-sedimentary domains are a result of sedimentary responses to sea level fluctuation during Late Quaternary, specially, during the deglaciation processes after the Last Glacial Maximum. The morphological and sedimentary contrasts along the area define the physical habitat distribution. The sediment supply regime area is associated with a terrigenous fine/muddy sedimentation bed, which control the local morphology and favors coastal and delta front progradation. This physical habitat is a well-known shrimp-fishing ground where intense trawling takes place, as well as gillnet fisheries targeting weakfish and croakers. The accommodation regime or low sediment influx area is characterized by carbonate sedimentation associated with hardgrounds and rhodolith beds. In contrast, this physical habitat with scarce sediment supply, facilitates extensive benthic colonization by crustose coralline algae (CCA), which is primarily associated to line fisheries, longlines, and spearfishing. Rhodoliths show a high diversity of CCA and the occurrence of an endemic kelp species. Long-term processes such as relative sea level fluctuations and sediment supply are a legacy for the distribution of benthic habitats, and their resulting morphology can be a surrogate for predicting fishing activities or a first-base analysis for marine spatial planning. Available low-resolution bathymetric datasets can be a powerful tool, if applied with caution and in a regional scale approach. Here, terrain variables (terrain slope and ruggedness) derived from an extensive available (low-resolution and interpolated) bathymetric dataset distinguished two contrasting morphological domains characterized by rugged and smooth/flat seabeds. © 2018 by the authors.

"85097914346","The knowledge of metal behavior in the aquatic environment is important for understanding its effects in estuarine zones and mangrove areas. These important and precious ecosystems are affected by many different factors that may vary temporally and spatially. The present study investigated the spatial and temporal variation of physicochemical parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, etc.) and metal concentrations (Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu) at three different locations along the Todos os Santos Bay, North East Brazil, by analyzing surface water, sediment and mangrove oysters (Cassostrea rhizophorae (Guildin, 1828)). Metal concentrations in surface waters and sediments differed between the three sampling times (March and August 2014; January 2015) and locations and were affected by fluctuating physicochemical parameters, which in this way also affected the metal bioconcentration in the oysters. The pH of the surface waters, for example, increased from the 1st to the 3rd sampling time while the concentrations of Zn and Fe decreased during the same period. The sediment concentrations of Zn and Fe were strongly correlated with organic matter content. These results suggests that seasonality as well as the different water and sediment properties along the bay directly affect metal concentration and bioavailability in the environment. © 2020, Universidade Estadual Paulista(UNESP).

"85093942688","The vegetation history and climate in southeastern Brazil, as well as the oceanic dynamics of the tropical Atlantic Ocean offshore, were reconstructed for the last 7.4 cal ka BP. This reconstruction was based on pollen, fern spores and dinoflagellate cysts identified in a marine core (CF10–04B). It was possible to verify the presence of an ombrophilous forest from 7.4 cal ka BP. Near the base of the PI zone low concentrations of pollen and fern spores are recorded, along with low frequencies of forest taxa and fern spores and an increase in pollen types of open vegetation, suggesting less humid climatic conditions than currently observed in the coastal regions of Southeastern Brazil. The assemblages of dinoflagellate cysts suggest a neritic zone with warm upper column temperature, high salinity and oligotrophic environment (evidenced by the presence of O. centrocarpum, Spiniferites spp. and L. machaerophorum). An increase in Tropical Waters (TW) and the approximation of the Brazilian Current (BC) in the middle shelf of southeastern Brazil in the mid-Holocene probably influenced the low accumulation of cysts, pollen grains, fern spores, and their associations. It is still possible to verify that at approximately 4.6 cal ka BP, an increase in the rainfall in the southeastern Brazilian region was probably the fundamental factor for the expansion of vegetation, mainly based on the considerable increases in hygrophytic and aquatic plants. The marked increase in the accumulation of dinoflagellate cysts, with the dominance of autotroph taxa (mainly O. centrocarpum, followed by Spiniferites spp), evidences the warmer waters of the BC and more intense surface upwelling of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW). © 2020","Land-sea correlation in southeastern Brazil during the last 7.4 cal ka BP: Vegetational, climatic and oceanographic inferences","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2020"
"85083341760","We present the first evidence of Archean oceanic crust submitted to Proterozoic high-pressure (HP) metamorphism in the South American Platform. Sm–Nd and Lu–Hf isotopic data combined with U–Pb geochronological data from the Campo Grande area, Rio Grande do Norte domain, in the Northern Borborema Province, reflect a complex Archean (2.9 ​Ga and 2.6 ​Ga) and Paleoproterozoic (2.0 ​Ga) evolution, culminating in the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano/Pan-African orogeny (ca. 600 Ma). The preserved mafic rocks contain massive poikiloblastic garnet and granoblastic amphibole with variable proportions of plagioclase ​+ ​diopside in symplectitic texture, typical of high-pressure rocks. These clinopyroxene-garnet amphibolites and the more common garnet amphibolites from the Campo Grande area are exposed as rare lenses within an Archean migmatite complex. The amphibolite lenses represent 2.65 ​Ga juvenile tholeiitic magmatism derived from depleted mantle sources (positive εHf(t) values of +3.81 to +30.66) later enriched by mantle metasomatism (negative εNd(t) values of –7.97). Chondrite and Primitive Mantle-normalized REE of analyzed samples and discriminant diagrams define two different oceanic affinities, with E-MORB and OIB signature. Negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu∗ ​= ​0.75–0.95) indicate depletion of plagioclase in the source. Inherited zircon cores of 3.0–2.9 ​Ga in analyzed samples indicate that the Neoarchean tholeiitic magmatism was emplaced into 2923 ​± ​14 ​Ma old Mesoarchean crust (εNd(t) ​= ​–2.58 and Nd TDM ​= ​3.2 ​Ga) of the Rio Grande do Norte domain. The age of retro-eclogite facies metamorphism is not yet completely understood. We suggest that two high-grade metamorphic events are recognized in the mafic rocks: the first at 2.0 ​Ga, recorded in some samples, and the second, at ca. 600 Ma, stronger and more pervasive and recorded in several of the mafic rock samples. The Neoproterozoic zircon grains are found in symplectite texture as inclusions in the garnet grains and represent the age of HP conditions in the area. These zircon grains show a younger cluster of concordant analyses between 623 ​± ​3 ​Ma and 592 ​± ​5 ​Ma with εHf(t) values of +0.74 to –65.88.

In coastal environments, the climate change influence on coastal ecosystems is particularly worrisome, affecting their configuration and restricting the ecosystem services they produce and their benefits to nature and society. This possible loss of ecosystem services translates well the significance of the “environmental risk” that climate change can cause. An assessment of the environmental risk generated by climate threats in coastal ecosystems was carried out through a South American case study developed on the Southern coast of Brazil – Estuary of Patos Lagoon. The study involved the implementation of a model that estimates the risk of losing ecosystem services used by different stakeholder groups as a function of (1) the climate threat, (2) the value of the service defined by the stakeholder perception, and (3) the vulnerability of each group in relation to a possible service loss. Based on information generated by scenarios predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and from a significant database collected from interviews of several service users, the model was able to generate levels of risks for different conditions. The calculated risk values, standardized to values between zero and one, allow numerous possibilities of evaluation for ecosystems, user groups and climate variability indicators. Moreover, the model appears as a tool capable of generating comparative risk levels and can help to establish environmental management policies related to the climatic effects and the necessary adaptations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","The risk to lose ecosystem services due to climate change: A South American case","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"

"85071847548","Mapping of natural gas hydrate systems has been performed successfully in the past using the controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) method. This method relies on differentiating resistive highly saturated free gas or hydrate bearing host sediment from a less resistive low-saturated gas or brine-bearing host sediments. Knowledge of the lateral extent and resistivity variations (and hence the saturation variations) within sediments that host hydrates is crucial to be able to accurately quantify the presence of saturated gas hydrates. A 3D CSEM survey (PUCRS14) was acquired in 2014 in the Pelotas Basin offshore Brazil, with hydrate resistivity mapping as the main objective. The survey was acquired within the context of the CONEGAS research project which investigated the origin and distribution of gas hydrate deposits in the Pelotas Basin. We inverted the acquired data using a proprietary 3D CSEM anisotropic inversion algorithm. Inversion was purely CSEM data-driven, and we did not include any a-priori information in the process. Prior to CSEM, interpretation of near-surface geophysical data including 2D seismic, sub-bottom profiler and multibeam bathymetry data indicated possible presence of gas hydrates within features identified such as faults, chimneys and seeps leading to pockmarks, along the bottom simulating reflector (BSR) and within the gas hydrate stability zone. Upon integration of the same with CSEM derived resistivity volume, the interpretation revealed excellent spatial correlation with many of these features. The interpretation further revealed new features with possible hydrate presence, which were previously overlooked due to a lack of a clear seismic and/or multibeam backscatter signature. Also, features which were previously mapped as gas hydrate bearing had to be reinterpreted as residual or low saturated gas/hydrate features, due to lack of significant resistivity response associated with them. We further used the inverted resistivity volume to derive saturation volume of the subsurface using Archie's equation. © 2019 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","3D CSEM IMAGING of GAS HYDRATES: INSIGHTS from the PELOTAS BASIN OFFSHORE Brazil","Society of Exploration Geophysicists",True,"2019"

"85008198009","The use of zinc isotopes to trace anthropogenic sources in coastal areas has been tested in this study. We determined the stable isotopic composition of zinc in sediment cores, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and rocks collected at the Sepetiba Bay (southeastern Brazil), an estuarine lagoon heavily impacted by metallurgic activities. These isotopic signatures were compared with those from willemite ore, which represent the main mineral refined by the major industrial source of zinc. The aim was to test if this tracer system enables to identify sources and sinks of anthropogenic zinc and to reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of zinc contamination. The zinc isotopic compositions (expressed using the δ66Zn notation relative to the JMC 3-0749-L solution) showed significant variations in the sediment cores, the SPM, and willemite ore minerals, ranging between − 0.01 and + 1.15‰. Spatial and temporal analysis of sediments samples fit well in a model of mixing involving three main end-members: i) Terrestrial background (δ66ZnJMC = + 0.28 ± 0.12‰, 2σ); ii) marine detrital material (δ66ZnJMC = + 0.45 ± 0.03‰, 2σ); and iii) a major anthropogenic source associated with electroplating wastes released into the bay (δ66ZnJMC = + 0.86 ± 0.15‰, 2σ). Sediment cores collected in the mud flats showed high correlation between δ66Zn and zinc enrichment factors, suggesting good preservation of the isotopic records of natural and anthropogenic sources. The sediment core sampled from a mangrove wetland located in a zone impacted by the metallurgy presented levels of zinc up to 4% (sediment dry weight) and preserved the isotopic signatures of electroplating wastes, despite evidences that post depositional processes slightly changed the isotopic signatures in some layers from this core toward heavier δ66ZnJMC values (above + 1.0‰). A two component mixing model suggests contributions of this major anthropogenic Zn source up to nearly 80% during periods of electroplating activities. Our work suggests that Zn isotope compositions of sediments are reliable tracers of anthropogenic sources and, therefore, can be useful to improve environmental monitoring efforts in coastal systems. © 2016","Tracing of anthropogenic zinc sources in coastal environments using stable isotope composition","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2017"

Statoil places a heavy emphasis on increased oil recovery (OIL), mostly developed in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and deployed elsewhere, to boost production at the field. Statoil partnered with service companies to develop and patent a version of autonomous inflow control devices (AICD), already tested on the NCS in two Norwegian fields to reduce water production. AICD distinguishes between high-viscosity oil and low-viscosity water and gas to allow in only the high-viscosity oil. Produced water is combined with treated sea water and pumped back into the reservoir to maintain pressure, a method called produced water reinjection. Other ways Statoil combats the difficulties that heavy oil like Peregrino's brings is through water as a way to transport the crude from the wellhead platforms to the FPSO.","Norwegian know - How",NULL,True,"2014"

"84955127995","The economic consequences of increased trade and foreign investment, as a result of greater economic integration between countries, are on the global agenda. The interaction between coastal environment and the external sector is one of the most challenging topics. The convergence of these themes has being provoking a heated debate among people which are favorable and contrary to the thesis of the incompatibility between increased trade and maintaining a pattern of economic development and sustainable environment. Thesis expanded to the possible incompatibility between the movement of international financial capital and foreign direct investment and sustainability. Categorically, this applies to exploration and production (E & P) of oil in the Brazilian Pre-Salt formation. Brazil must inspect and monitor any process of exploration, mainly offshore, in the coastal territory of its jurisdiction. In this respect, it is noteworthy that PETROBRAS (the lead oil company in the country) has become the technology leader in deep and ultra-deep waters, which guarantees to Brazil at the time, the control of its maritime rich resources relating to exploration and exploitation of oil and natural gas. Thus, we recognize the issue of technological competition as a determinant for the productive internalization process. This process, especially among developed countries, should be understood as the result of technological capability, which multinational companies are able to appropriate due to the existence of ""overflows"" from the system. Therefore, we intend to clarify the extent to which Brazilian law ""protects"" the exploitation of natural resources, especially hydrocarbons, from a coastal environment approach. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"85088202607","Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) success depends on producing seamless short- and long-wavelength model updates while avoiding cycle skipping. In its traditional implementation, FWI risks converging to an inaccurate result if the data lacks sufficient low frequencies or the starting model is far from the true one. Additionally, the model updates may display a reflectivity imprint before the long-wavelength features are fully recovered. A solution to these fundamental challenges combines the quadratic form of the Wasserstein distance (W2-norm) for measuring the data misfit with a robust implementation of a velocity gradient. The W2-norm reduces the risk of cycle skipping whereas the velocity gradient effectively eliminates the reflectivity imprint and emphasizes the long-wavelength model updates. We illustrate the performance of the new solution on a field survey acquired offshore Brazil. There, we demonstrate how FWI successfully updates the earth model and resolves a high-velocity carbonate layer that was missing from the starting model. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019.

Five companies have come together in a consortium together with Pré-sal Petróleo SA (PPSA) to develop this area under the country's first Production Sharing Contract (PSC). While still in the exploration phase, the project has been moving at a rapid pace, creating full field development scenarios, drilling wells, developing a system to collect dynamic reservoir information, and preparing for the initiation of its first production FPSO project. Ultimately, the field could see the drilling of nearly a hundred deepwater wells and the installation of several very large FPSOs. The area will be active with seismic, drilling, construction, production, installation and support vessels for many years. By applying industry safety statistics to the large number of man-hours required to bring these plans to life, the potential for fatalities, Lost Time Accidents (LTI's) and other HSE incidences associated with the project can be statistically extrapolated. With these figures in mind, Project Leadership embarked upon a program to substantially improve safety performance with an objective to not only develop this rare field efficiently, but to establish a legacy of exceptional HSE performance. Now three years into Libra's exploration and development, and already exceeding 20 million man-hours expended, this paper seeks to share the steps taken to improve the HSE Culture of the Libra team and the performance of its contractors and subcontractors.

A summary of published literature on fossil coccolithophores from the marine Cenozoic record of South America reveals that our study is the first to report Lower Eocene coccolith-bearing sedimentary rocks in the substratum of the Caribbean inland margin. The assemblages are characterized by common occurrences of Reticulofenestra dictyoda and Sphenolithus radians and sporadic occurrences of Girgisia gammation, Heliodiscoaster lodoensis, and Sphenolithus orphanknolli. The co-occurrence of H. lodoensis, R. dictyoda, and S. orphanknolli indicates that the core between 1190 ft (362 m) and 279 ft (85 m) encompasses Zone NP12 to Subzone NP14a and spans the interval between ~53 to ~48.3 Ma of the latest Early Eocene (Late Ypresian Age). Small placoliths (R. dictyoda and Reticulofenestra <3 lm) and sphenoliths (S. radians and Sphenolithus spp.) dominate the tropical assemblages. Other species include Campylosphaera dela, Coccolithus formosus, Coccolithus pelagicus, Helicosphaeroides lophota, Helicosphaeroides seminulum, and Pontosphaera spp. Investigations on calcareous nannofossil distribution in Cenozoic marine sediments from South America are few, and most published information concerns the Brazilian continental margin and inland Argentina.

The estuary is also part of the Rio Pacoti Environmental Protection Area (Rio Pacoti EPA), which is important for the stability of the local ecosystems and the exchange of material and energy. Despite being protected legally, the environmental quality of the study area is being threatened by impacts such as the deforestation, landfills, the contamination of the water table, and unregulated building, which all alter the natural dynamics of the local systems. These impacts result from inadequate processes of land use and occupation, which fail to respect local potentialities and limitations. The present study found that these processes of degradation are ongoing, and do not only contradict the legislation that regulates the sustainable use of the local environment, but may also cause irreparable damage to the local geo-ecological systems, constituting a grave problem for this sector of the coast of Ceará. In this context, the study presents a geo-environmental description of the estuary and an integrated diagnosis, based on the geoecological analysis of the landscape, in two phases -organization and survey, analysis, diagnosis, and proposals. The application of this geo-ecological analysis resulted in the demarcation and classification of the following units: coastal plain and the pre-coastal plateau.

"11244281653","Petrobras has been successfully dealing with deep water floating production systems using flexible pipes since 1977. During the completion of Marlim South 3 well in 1977, Petrobras was surprised by the occurrence of two birdcage type failures. At that time, Marlim South 3, in a water depth of 1709 m was the deepest offshore production well in operation. Since then. Petrobras has been testing flexible pipes using a field test known as DIP test. In a DIP test, an empty end capped sample of a flexible pipe, about 150m long, is partially-supported by the sea bottom and connected to a lay vessel by a pipe follower or a wire rope. The flexible pipe has to withstand a 4 hour period of cyclic bending due to the motions of the lay vessel. The DIP test has provided Petrobras with information on a new failure mode: lateral buckling in the armor wire. Although a birdcage failure is equally undesirable, lateral buckling of the armor wires implies more danger because it can go unnoticed. In 2001, a research project was set up by the Research and Development Center of Petrobras that was aimed at reproducing the flexible pipe failure modes under laboratory conditions. The purpose was to obtain a better understanding of the failure process, as well as to develop testing alternatives to avoid the significant costs related to DIP tests. In order to assess the effect of cyclic bending as a major factor in degrading the longitudinal compressive strength of flexible pipes 15 destructive tests were performed on 4-inch diameter flexible pipe samples. Two test rigs that accommodated three types of test and a number of test procedures were developed in the project. The number of bending cycles to failure for each sample was determined when subjected to compressive action corresponding to its operational depth. Tests to evaluate the effect of pre-existing damage were also conducted. Special attention was devoted to the effect of layer arrangement on compressive failure. The test results clearly identified the basic failure modes under investigation (i. e. birdcaging and lateral buckling of the armor wires). Suggestions regarding simplified testing procedures and corresponding performance criteria are also presented.","Flexible pipe sensitivity to birdcaging and armor wire lateral buckling",NULL,True,"2004"
"85037355639","The Cretaceous Bauru Group of the Paraná Basin in Brazil is a widespread continental unit well known for its vertebrate and invertebrate fossiliferous content. The São Carlos Formation is an exception among its distinct and dominantly reddish siliciclastic units, which are otherwise devoid of palynomorphs. It includes an unique unit, the Ibaté Bed, which corresponds to the lower interval of the Fazenda Nossa Senhora de Fátima Member (FNSF Mbr) and is represented by a dark grey organic silty-argillaceous rhythmite with a rich palynoflora. These rocks are the main focus of this study. Samples were collected from the type section of the formation that is located in the central area of the São Paulo State. Identified palynomorph types are as follows: 32 pteridophyte spore taxa, 31 gymnosperm pollen taxa and 64 angiosperm pollen taxa. Acritarchs, prasinophytes and phytoclasts were also recognized. Seven new taxa are proposed: Anacolosidites eosenonicus sp. nov., Leiosphaeridia ibateensis sp. nov., Stellatia gen. nov., Trichomites brevifurcatus gen. et sp. nov., Trichomites duplihelicoidus gen. et sp. nov., Trichomites simplex gen. et sp. nov. and Tricolpites joelcastroi sp. nov. In quantitative terms, the ephedroid pollen grains – e.g., Equisetosporites, Gnetaceaepollenites and Steevesipollenites – are predominant. Their occurrence associated with Classopollis grains suggest a warm climate tending towards dryness. Some levels are relatively rich in pteridophyte spores, suggestive of contribution from lakeside vegetation. The permanent presence of freshwater is attested by conspicuous microalgal remains (Botryococcus, Pediastrum, Staurastrum and prasinophycean phycomata), recognizable via fluorescence microscopy. Significant amounts of microalgal remains in some samples suggest episodic blooms in the lake, probably induced by eutrophication. The Ibaté Bed corresponds to a depositional scenario involving a distal lacustrine environment with low-oxygen conditions in its bottom waters. As observed in offshore Brazilian basins, the presence of Anacolosidites eosenonicus sp. nov., combined with the absence of Steevesipollenites nativensis, indicates a late Santonian age for the bed (ca. 84 Ma). Other associated index-palynomorphs are compatible with this time assignment, which is reinforced by the presence of carbonized sclereids that are associated with the “Great Santonian Wildfire” recorded in coeval marine offshore strata of the Campos and Santos basins. The FNSF Mbr is stratigraphically related to the uppermost part of the Adamantina and Uberaba formations of the Bauru Group. Among all known Brazilian Late Cretaceous palynological continental records, this is the richest one ever detected.

"85085773875","Currently, low oil prices pose a challenge to the financial state of the industry. Therefore, it is very important that companies optimize costs while maintaining or even increasing oil production. At the same time, with oil production declining due high water cuts and facility volume limitations in an offshore production system, it is necessary to look for solutions in order to maintain economic viability by increasing oil recovery in mature reservoirs. Among some alternatives, the subsea separator represents a good prospect for dealing with these challenges. This paper aims to describe a methodology to perform the technical feasibility study of deploying an Oil/Water Subsea Separator in Brazilian Offshore Field. The technical results were then used as part of an economic analysis which is outside the scope of the present paper. The study is comprised four wells that are linked to the manifold and the subsea separator. In the subsea separator, 70% of the produced water is separated and reinjected in a disposal well. Hence, the fluids which remains (oil, gas and 30% of water) flows up to the platform. Since this reinjected water volume is not flowing to the platform anymore, more fluid can be processed, allowing the wells to operate on larger potentials resulting in an increased cumulative oil production to the field. Computational simulation approach was followed by using the pore flow simulation, flow assurance simulation and a coupler that integrates both of these. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Methodology to a feasibility study to implement an oil/water subsea separation","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"

This paper highlights the main differences between the two systems and when it is beneficial to employ movable systems. There are many parameters to consider in determining which system to use - also a traditional system involving a single winch or chain jack per mooring line may in many cases be preferred. The movable chain jack concept is designed to operate multiple mooring lines within the same cluster. A single chain jack is lifted by a skidding gantry and moved to the next mooring line and so forth. Installation and messenger chains are moved using a large sliding chain locker allowing for later offloading of the surplus chain. The movable windlass system is also designed to operate multiple mooring lines within the same cluster. However, in this case the winch is rotary and can operate via electric or hydraulic power. One of the main considerations is to move the windlass and keep the mooring lines intact without cutting them.

It produced from a single well with a drilling riser and dry-X-tmas tree to a MODU converted into a floating production unit and exporting to a spread-moored shuttle-tanker by a floating hose. Now, more than 40 years later, over 2,400 meters of water depth at Santos Basin are moored several floating production and storage units (FPSOs). It houses over 40 thousand metric tons of complex topsides exploiting ultra-deep wells from the pre-salt prospects. Along the evolution of the FPSOs, one major stepping-stone was the implementation of lessons learned as a feedback to create a strong foundation. This paper will depict field demands and solutions adopted to deal with the differing climates and environments as well as other particularities to develop FPSOs in Brazil. To face the technological challenges to efficiently and safely produce from ultra-deep water complex pre-salt reservoirs required the consolidated use of the expertise and experience from past projects. Initially Petrobras was well known worldwide as a Semi-Submersible company, with a unique proficiency to develop converted Semi-submersibles and other new constructions. This expertise is still present to this day, but the company has since pioneered and consolidated the use of FPSOs worldwide, leading the industry in this concept. Petrobras led the industry effort to approve FPSO international standards, local regulations with agencies and regulatory bodies by the end of '80s to early '90s.

In this study, we evaluated the influence of river discharge on the OM accumulation pattern in a portion of the NE Brazilian continental margin (10–15°S) by considering a suite of lipid biomarkers (sterols, n-alcohols, phytol and taraxerol) in surface sediments. A total of 36 samples were collected adjacent to river mouths representing drainage basins of varying size and representing different human intervention levels, namely the São Francisco, Vaza Barris, Sergipe and Piauí-Real rivers. The average concentration of the total quantified lipids was 3.77 ± 1.93 µg g−1, with the lowest values detected at the São Francisco River pro-delta. This result seems to reflect the reductions in the São Francisco river flow during the last decades caused by human interventions (diverse water use and urbanization, among others) and climate change (reduced precipitation) along its drainage basin, which seems to affect other smaller basins to a lesser extent. Our findings highlight that human interventions and climate change are relevant drivers for biogeochemical processes even in shelves receiving the flow from small to medium rivers in Brazil, which agree with other records worldwide.

"85033225585","Surface Related Multiple Elimination (SRME) has been approved to be an effective demultiple tool for marine data processing. However, it breaks down when applied to shallow water data mainly because 1) missing or contaminated near-offsets lead to inaccurate multiple models; 2) the cross-talk of short-period multiples deteriorate the matching filter during the adaptive subtraction; 3) the spectrum of the multiple model is distorted by the extra source signature. This paper proposes a new approach that combines a model-based method and a conventional SRME to serve the means of shallow water multiple elimination (SWME). The advantages include: 1) replacing the water-bottom Green's functions with broadband wavelets predicts the correct amplitudes of the multiples; 2) limiting the aperture of the Green's functions to the distance where the critical reflection occurs suppresses the artefacts in the multiple model and lowers the cost; 3) Simultaneously subtracting both the receiver- and source-side water-bottom multiples significantly improves the efficiency; 4) a following SRME helps remove the residual non-water-bottom multiples. A broadband 2D line offshore Santos, Brazil is tested with the proposed approach.

However, since 2004, two tropical cyclones have been recorded in the southwest Atlantic Ocean and one subtropical that had the potential to become tropical. Adequate locations for the genesis of tropical cyclones can be identified through the index of the potential of genesis, which is a methodology developed by Dr. Kerry Emanuel and collaborators. Therefore, the objective of the study is to contribute to the climatological knowledge of regions favorable to the genesis of tropical cyclones in the vicinity of South America using the genesis potential index. Moreover, we analyze some oceanic and atmospheric variables important to cyclogenesis. To this end, the ERA5 reanalysis data from the 1989-2019 period are used, which is considered state-of-the-art in terms of reanalysis. The results show the climatology of the genesis potential index, the components of this index, and other atmospheric and oceanic variables that are important for the development of tropical systems. The main result obtained in the study is the presence of potential for tropical cyclogenesis in the Atlantic Ocean along the Brazilian coast. In October, a weak signal appears between the coast of Bahia and Espírito Santo. This signal intensifies, obtaining maximum intensity between February and March when it also reaches the south coast of Brazil. Therefore, the use of a robust methodology applied in state-of-the-art data demystifies the hypothesis that there is no potential for the genesis of tropical cyclones off the coast of Brazil. © 2021, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

"84897381844","Drilling salt zones, especially in deep and ultra-deep waters, presents several challenges to be overcome. One of the main problems faced by drilling engineers while designing and executing a section in salt zones, is the formation flow to the wellbore. Temperature and pressure exerted by the rocks above the salt formation make it have a plastic behavior that tend to flow, and close the wellbore caliper as the bit drills it. The deeper the salt formation, the higher the temperature and pressure above it and, consequently, the higher the tendency to flow to the well, causing several problems, such as high torque, drag and stuckpipes. In order to avoid these problems and to keep the wellbore stable, the drilling fluid must exert a minimum hydrostatic pressure on the formation. Thus, the mud weight is a very important parameter that needs to be determined with a good precision. Since there are no reliable tools to help drilling designers to predict the mud weight based on the wellbore information and its lithology, this is a very difficult task. Nowadays, the prediction of mud weights for pre-salt wells is made based on the designer experience and it's updated during the drilling job as the engineers analyze the wellbore behavior. The lack of precision on estimating the correct mud weight causes several operational problems, currently related to high nonproductive times. Petrobras is developing software to predict adequate mud weight in order to avoid salt fluency based on the lithology of the well and a big historic of wells drilled in pre-salt zones. Initial tests show that the software is able to predict the mud weight with a very good precision. This article shows the development of the software and initial results obtained.

EPA method describes procedures to evaluate toxicity using Leptocheirus plumulosus. Despite being an exotic species, Brazilian laboratories keep L. plumulosus cultures. Otherwise, Grandidierella bonnieroides is widely distributed in Brazilian estuaries is successfully cultured and sensitive to many toxicants. The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of three non-aqueous drilling fluids (NAF) and two synthetic based drilling muds (SBM) spiked to natural sediment on the amphipods. Reference toxicant experiments were also performed using C16C18 internal olefin or a C16C18 internal olefin SBM of similar density. Sediment was collected in Jabaquara beach, RJ and transferred to the laboratory in chilly bins. After sieving, it was kept at 4 ± 2 °C until spiking for no longer than 60 days. Spiking procedures and whole-sediment tests were set up following the methods described in EPA method 1644 and Brazilian Standards. Amphipods were exposed to 5 concentrations of SBM and NAF spiked sediment plus controls for 4 and 10 days, respectively, in static system. In NAF tests using G. bonnieroides the average LC50 obtained were 3.53 g.kg-1dw (n= 7; SD=1.63; CV= 46.07%), 1.33 g.kg-1dw (n= 6; SD=0.69; CV= 52.15%) and 0.56 g.kg-1dw (n= 7; SD=0.24; CV= 42.69%) for olefin, ester and paraffin, respectively, while L. plumulosus showed an average LC50 of 1.66 g.kg-1dw (n= 6; SD=1.30; CV= 78.10%), 0.60 g.kg-1dw (n= 5; SD=0.22; CV=35.81%) and 0.26 g.kg-1dw (n= 6; SD=0.13; CV= 50.50%), respectively.

"84878941411","The Santa Marta Grande Cape (CSM) area, a relatively steep and narrow continental shelf off southeast Brazil, is under the influence of the Brazil Current and intense seasonal variations of the wind field that affect the composition of water masses and their circulation. Hydrographic data, satellite-derived wind stress, and numerical simulations are used to characterize the seasonal and shorter period variability of the oceanographic conditions off CSM, in the area between 27°S and 30°S. The study is focused on the upwelling episodes and the dynamical mechanisms associated with these events. Field data and numerical results indicate significant seasonal changes in the oceanographic structure, the water mass composition, and the dynamical balance. During fall and winter, when southwesterly winds prevail and the frequency of meteorological frontal systems increases, the region is characterized by waters of continental origin, the Plata Plume Water (PPW). During spring and summer, deeper waters reach the surface layer due to the action of northeasterly winds. Coastal upwelling events are revealed by surface temperature minima observed south of CSM. Synoptic data show that these events occur in pulses associated with changes in the wind direction. Analysis of the numerical results shows that this particular location of the upwelling band results from the synergy between shelf-break upwelling and the regional shelf circulation induced by the northeasterly winds, both of which are modulated by changes in the coastline orientation and shelf width. © 2013.

The derived large-scale fields have large diurnal variations according to convective activity in the GoAmazon region and the morning profiles show distinct differences between the dry and wet seasons. In the wet season, propagating convective systems originating far from the GoAmazon region are often seen in the early morning, while in the dry season they are rarely observed. Afternoon convective systems due to solar heating are frequently seen in both seasons. Accordingly, in the morning, there is strong upward motion and associated heating and drying throughout the entire troposphere in the wet season, which is limited to lower levels in the dry season. In the afternoon, both seasons exhibit weak heating and strong moistening in the boundary layer related to the vertical convergence of eddy fluxes.

The proposed procedure is limited to the ultimate limit state (ULS) and considers mooring lines made up of chain and polyester rope segments, although the same methodology can be applied to cases with steel wire segments. The proposed procedure can also be applied for mooring lines connected to any other type of floating offshore structure. For reliability assessments, it is necessary to consider the distributions and the probabilistic aspects of the random variables involved in the process. The weakest link system is used to model the strength of a mooring line segment. Simplified time-dependent probabilistic models for chain corrosion and polyester degradation are adopted to predict the strength degradation over time. The annual failure probability for different years is estimated by approximating the degraded strength by a piecewise constant model in order to perform a time variant reliability analysis. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the failure probability.

"85084945361","The recovery of a pipeline inspection gauge (PIG) left in a subsea production flowline in an unknown location after a failed cleaning and inspection operation is discussed. Combined with paraffin deposits, the production flowline of the best offshore producer in northeast Brazil was completely blocked. Extensive planning was necessary to spot the coiled tubing (CT) equipment to accommodate the deck configuration of the floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel and to overcome dimensional and load capacity limitations. A customized extendable jacking frame was manufactured to support the CT injector and provide room for a work window. This fit-for-purpose rigging was necessary to enable the viability of the cleanout in the production flowline of the well. CT operation modeling software was used to analyze the hydraulic and force simulations to verify that the CT would reach the target depth with optimal jetting efficiency and would tailor the cleanout methodology. Paraffin was successfully cleaned from the flowline, and the PIG was released and recovered on surface. The CT was efficiently and safely rigged up on a FPSO without any nonproductive time or service quality issues. The versatility of CT services to not only deliver intervention services on conventional wells but to also adapt to rig up in extreme geometries and environments are showcased along with how CT services can be applied to flowline interventions. For this case, a customized CT frame was manufactured to overcome the challenges of rigging up on a vessel with extremely limited deck space and load capacities and restoring hydrocarbon production after a failed PIG procedure.

To understand the outcomes of hybridization and their consequences for sea turtle conservation, we need to evaluate the extent of hybridization occurrence and possible deleterious effects in the hybrid progeny. Thus, we investigated the hypothesis of the existence of a new hybrid spot offshore of Brazil’s northeastern coast. The Abrolhos Archipelago is surrounded by the largest and richest coral reefs in the South Atlantic and is known to be a nesting site for loggerhead turtles (Carettacaretta). In this study, we performed a multidisciplinary investigation into levels of hybridization in sea turtles and their reproductive output in the Abrolhos beaches. Genetic data from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and six autosomal markers showed that there are first-generation hybrid females nesting in Abrolhos, resulting from crossings between hawksbill males (Eretmochelysimbricata) and loggerhead females, and backcrossed hatchlings from both parental species. The type and extent of hybridization were characterized using genomic data obtained with the 3RAD method, which confirmed backcrossing between F1 hybrids and loggerhead turtles. The reproductive output data of Abrolhos nests suggests a disadvantage of hybrids when compared to loggerheads. For the first time, we have shown the association between hybridization and low reproductive success, which may represent a threat to sea turtle conservation. © 2020, The Author(s).","Genomic evidence of recent hybridization between sea turtles at Abrolhos Archipelago and its association to low reproductive output","Nature Research",True,"2020"

"84879432080","Two of the biggest drivers in Middle East oil & gas operations today are the continued development and upgrade of existing facilities (Brownfield Projects) and the challenges involved in developing high pressure, high temperature (HP/HT) fields. These developments come with very different piping and pipeline challenges. In the case of Brownfield projects, it is the ageing piping installations with increased corrosion and leaks, and the need to carry out piping modifications while continuing production. And in the case of HP/HT developments, the challenges include the need to develop robust and effective instrumentation, reliable connections, reduce subsea intervention costs, and operate around existing infrastructure. This paper will look at how cold-work piping connection solutions can accommodate the challenges involved in Brownfield projects and HP/HT applications, as well as alleviating concerns over traditional methods, such as welding. Such concerns include time, cost, resources, and safety implications. Referring to the experience gained from installing over 3,000 cold-work connections worldwide, this paper will examine how cold-work solutions generate a simple mechanical connection; the technology of using hydraulic pipes to flange expansion in developing leak-free connections; the importance of no gasket, seals or moving parts in the connection; and the flexibility needed to handle a range of piping diameters.

This data set is leading to a better understanding of the crustal transition processes and on the evolution of the oceanic crust over that part of the Brazilian continental margin. On our seismic transects, we show a rifted marginal plateau (Pernambuco Plateau) where crustal extension was controlled by detachment faulting, possibly in a non-volcanic margin setting. Farther north, dealing with the ocean-continent transition nearby a major transform margin, we found a normal passive margin-style transition zone instead of transform-related structures. With the support of multichannel seismic profiles and gravity data derived from GEOSAT altimetry, several well-known oceanic fracture zones and structural lineaments were properly located and correlated. The relationship of these structures with volcanic ridges and extensional, compressive and strike-slip tectonic reactivations suggests that fracture zones at this area behaved either as zones of weakness or as locked transform fault scars. Striking lithospheric flexural deformation is also related to FZs in this region. In the surroundings of the Fernando de Noronha Ridge, lithospheric flexure represents an isostatic response to volcanic loading, while bending across Ascension FZ is likely to have been caused by differential subsidence in crustal segments of contrasting ages. We also correlate some other deformation of the oceanic crust with changes in spreading directions that possibly took place at the Upper Cretaceous. © 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.","Ocean-continent transition and tectonic framework of the oceanic crust at the continental margin off NE Brazil: Results of LEPLAC project","Blackwell Publishing Ltd",True,"2000"

As an FPSO is one of most common types of production units adopted by Petrobras, its behavior in extreme conditions has to be fully tested and verified. During extreme sea storms, ship type floating structures may be subjected to water on deck events (green water). In order to allow a detailed structural analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques may be used to investigate detailed loads due to water on deck propagation, especially in beam sea conditions, which are not traditionally covered by maritime rules. Based on model test results, water ingress and water on deck propagation are simulated through CFD analysis. The methodology adopted consists of two different approaches: (i) The influence of a riser balcony lateral extent is analyzed based on a 2D wave propagation model and; (ii) the complex flow behavior through topside equipment is discussed by using a 3D simulation of a restricted deck area, including some strategies for impact protection. The results of the simulations allow investigation of the complex flow behavior depending on the riser balcony extent and topside configuration, as well as the resulting loads on critical structures. For a side hull balcony, its protective effect against wave run-up in beam waves is only effective with a lateral extent of 8m. By performing water on deck simulations, the benefits of ""V"" type protections are quantified leading to 20% loading reduction when compared to flat plates.

"84856625676","Cottonwood is the first field development in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operated by Petrobras. It consists of three subsea wells in water depths of 670m (2,200 ft). Two wells presently produce gas-condensate, with high wax deposition potential. The wells are connected to a fixed platform in East Cameron 373 Block, 27.2 km (17 miles) away, through a piggable loop with flowlines of 15.2 cm (6″) nominal and 12.2 cm (4.8″) ID. During a pigging procedure in December 2007, a rigid, 12.9 cm (5.1″) elastomer pig got trapped halfway in the East segment of the loop, after traveling through the West segment. In front of the pig a slug of paraffin was formed and impeded its passage. During two years the production continued through the still open West segment of the production flowline. A wax mitigation plan was implemented, consisting of continuous paraffin dispersant injection. Meanwhile, low-cost, advanced technology-based methods to remove the obstruction were pursued, as an alternative to the high-cost whole or partial East flowline substitution. The procedures attempted were, first, the controlled pressurization of the flowline, second, the application of associated vibration and pressurization. These methods, along with paraffin solvent soaking procedures, helped to release the pig in February 2010, making both segments available for production. However, a layer of wax was formed inside the flowline loop and pig fragments might still be present in the East segment. A cleaning operation was performed to further clean both flowline segments. The operation consisted of injecting sea water mixed with a dispersant, an approach, to our best knowledge, not attempted before in such a long subsea tie-back. The formulations used were thoroughly laboratory tested. The operation demanded noticeable logistics planning and execution, due to the flowline volume (4000 bbl) and the number of volumes circulated (circa of 10). The operation was a success, thereby allowing the restoration of production with full flowline diameter availability and the resumption of routine pigging of the loop.

This paper presents the results for the water column and sediment monitoring 10 days after the spill, including n-alkanes, unresolved complex mixture (UCM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and toxicological essays. Chemical and toxicological monitoring of the water column was performed at 14 sampling stations throughout the impacted area in Guanabara Bay. The chemical analysis of PAHs by ultraviolet fluorescence showed results from &lt;0.04-11.56 μg/L-1 in chrysene equivalents. The toxicological essays for three species (Artemia sp., Mysidium gracile, and Vibrio fisheri, Microtox) indicate no acute effects for the water samples studied. To monitor sediments, 57 samples were collected from intertidal and subtidal sites. For the 30 intertidal sediments, 73% contained PAHs (GC-MS) below 2 μg/g -1, 20% were in the range 2-5 μg/g-1, and only two stations (7%), located in the vicinity of the spill point, contained levels up to 20 μg/g-1. For the 27 subtidal sediments, results were in the range of 0.2-9.6 μg/g-1 for PAHs, 0.7-43.3 μ/g/g-1 for n-alkanes, and 17.8-1,250 μg/g-1 for UCM.

In sediments, only COC was quantified in concentrations ranging from 0.94 ng·g−1 to 46.85 ng·g−1. Similarly, only COC was detected in tissues of mussels 0.914 μg·kg−1 to 4.58 μg·kg−1 (ww). The field-measured BAF ranged from 163 to 1454 (L·kg−1). Our results pointed out a widespread contamination by cocaine and its main human metabolite benzoylecgonine in Santos Bay. Mussels were able to accumulate COC in areas used by residents and tourists for bathing, fishing, and harvest, denoting concern to human health. Therefore, our data can be considered a preliminary assessment, which indicates the need to evaluate drugs (including illicit as COC) in environmental and seafood monitoring programs, in order to understand their risks on the ecosystem and human health. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Mussels get higher: A study on the occurrence of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in seawater, sediment and mussels from a subtropical ecosystem (Santos Bay, Brazil)","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2021"
"80052582062","The Brazilian Pre-Salt region has garnered much attention since the first major discoveries were announced by Petrobras, in 2006. Since then, discoveries in the region have ranked among the largest in the world in the last ten years, including Tupi, Iara, and Libra. This led to various estimates, from within and outside the government, that mentioned extremely large total possible accumulations, ranging from 50 to over 300 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the ""Picanha Azul"" region, an area of approximately 150 thousand square kilometers. Since none of these estimates was accompanied by technical data, or a description of the methodology used, an assessment of the potential for yet-to-find oil was carried out using a software tool which models the exploration process, making Monte Carlo simulations based on the information available regarding wells drilled, discoveries made, respective dates, and the areas involved. The assessment methodology used has been successfully applied by the authors in evaluating the potential of other areas, such as the shallow waters of the Campos Basin. While the present Pre-Salt region assessment does not have as many information points available as in those prior assessments, the intense exploration activity has resulted in enough information being available about the region so as to be able conduct an assessment over the entire area. Applying the concepts of discovery sequence and field size distribution, and making geological estimates for parameters of the number and size of accumulations, the current assessment furnished a probability distribution for the number and expected size of individual accumulations (fields) yet to be discovered, as well as for the total accumulation of yet-to-find recoverable oil in the region. The relatively large range of possible values of the results reflects the lack of more exploratory experience (discoveries or dry wells), which will only come about with time, despite the intense exploratory efforts currently under way. Even so, it was possible to suggest that within probabilistic confidence levels of 95% and 5%, field sizes expected will range from 165 million barrels to eight billion barrels, and total accumulations will range from 115 billion barrels to over 288 billion barrels.

"84897448998","In Brazil, environmental laws define oil containment and collection as a primary strategy to oil spills originated by exploitation and production enterprises that reaches water bodies. Thus, it is foreseen a continuous equipment increase over the time, in a scaled response, always in accordance to accidental scenarios forecasted in the enterprise risk assessment. This way, minor spills, with higher probability to occur, require smaller resources, however made available in a smaller rage of time, whereas larger and less frequent spills must be attended to with strongest resources, in a larger period of time. At Brazilian maritime zones with higher exploitation and production activities the use of larger vessels, aiming to solve the worst cases, was prioritizred. Such vessels are also used to respond the small and medium discharges, which could be solved by less robust vessels. The use of smaller and fastest vessels and simpler equipment to be operated allows the fleet's rationalization and a quicker and more effective response to more frequent situations. This changing also fosters economic profits (by reducing the figures and the fees paid by vessels chartering) and environmental benefits (by reducing emissions and the fuel consumption). In order to represent this situation, this paper compares the compliance with requirements from regulatory agency using an exclusive fleet of traditional boats and a fleet of traditional boats and fast response. A case study will be presented, considering a high activity oilfield on Brazilian coast.

"25144481375","The main tectonic, stratigraphic and sedimentological aspects of the Aptian Stage along the Brazilian Eastern Basins were analyzed based on data from 28 wells drilled by Petrobras, including the description of 750 meters of cores. The Aptian along the Eastern Margin (from Santos to Camamu-Almada basins) can be subdivided into 2 main packages with specific tectonic and sedimentological characteristics. The Lower Aptian (upper part of Jiquiá to lower part of Alagoas local stages) is characterized by continental sedimentation under rift tectonics. Scarce marine incursions were recognized in this package. Sedimentation occurred mainly in grabens located in the central portions of the rift and in scattered grabens located in proximal areas. This caused subaerial exposure of large proximal areas generating a regional unconformity called ""pre-Upper Aptian Unconformity"". The Upper Aptian (Upper Alagoas local stage) package was deposited under stable tectonic conditions in a sag basin. The lower portion of this unit is characterized by a fluvio-alluvial sedimentation with a widespread occurrence throughout the proximal areas of all marginal basins. Distal sediments however were deposited under shallow marine conditions. At the end of the Aptian a strong period of aridity and the presence of a volcanic barrier, the São Paulo High, allowed the deposition of a very thick evaporitic package (""Ibura Event""). These evaporites are estimated to be deposited in about 600,000 years.","Tectonic, stratigraphy and sedimentation during the Aptian along the brasilian eastern margin [Tectônica, estratigrafia e sedimentação no Andar Aptiano da margem leste brasileira]",NULL,True,"2004"
"85066617192","Offshore oil development projects are complex and require high capital investment. The application of methodologies that seek optimization of economic parameters of projects became particularly important since 2014, when oil barrel prices plummeted. At that moment, some projects required modifications to regain economical attractivity. The recovery of project profitability depended on the break-even oil price criterion fulfillment (typically USD 40-45) among other requirements. This paper presents a methodology developed by Petrobras to increase the profitability of offshore projects in conceptual design phase while meeting the technical and safety minimum requirements. Successful solutions provided by the Petrobras team, enabled through this methodology, to make more than 15 projects economically viable are presented. The solutions include phased development, reuse of flexible lines from declining production wells, application of new technologies (including boosting and processing), use of innovative subsea architectures, procedures to increase ramp-up speed, long tie-backs, etc. This article is focused on subsea engineering solutions.

"85050680089","In general, Oil Companies need a contract with the government to have legal rights to carry out Exploration and Production (E&P) projects. In this work, we discuss contractual and economic issues in (E&P) sector in Brazil and the dynamics of uncertainties throughout the stages of an E&P project. This study uses Petroleum Resource Management System - PRMS (SPE, et al., 2007) concepts, its reserve categorization and indicators to measure uncertainty in oil and gas projects. First, we analyze complexities resulting from different contractual regimes and their limits - time, area and cumulative production - as well as the impact on the management of Field Development Plans (FDP). Under these limits, not all production and resources are included in the contract, affecting volume amount, property rights and fiscal regime. Time limits affect decisions about the remaining reserves after the end of contract, while area issues occur when reservoirs extend beyond the geographical boundary of an exploratory block. Cumulative production limit appears in the Transfer of Rights Agreement (TRA), which authorized the Brazilian Government to assign 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent to Petrobras in 2010. The National Agency of Petroleum (ANP) promoted technical studies that indicated the recoverable volume in the area of TRA exceeds the limits originally agreed. In the second part, we use the 12-step integrated decision analysis methodology by Schiozer, et al. (2015) and PRMS reserve indicators to describe the dynamics of uncertainties throughout exploration, development and production phases. Through reservoir simulation and the optimization of a production strategy, we measured the key reserve indicators in different phases of a project. The increment of developed reserves due to the introduction of wells, in the development, and the reclassification of resources, in the management phase, are assessed probabilistically. The novel information of this work is the use of the PRMS international standard and the 12-step methodology to not only calculate reserves, but also describe the dynamics of uncertainties throughout a Development Project and to qualify complex contractual and economic issues. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.","Dynamic uncertainties appraisal throughout a development project, applying prms indicators of resource and reserves categorization","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2018"

In addition, industries as well as urban and tourism activities are potential sources of pollution in this area. In the present study, sediment samples from 12 stations along the estuarine system were collected and extracted followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analysis. Eight sterols were identified and quantified, indicating natural and anthropogenic sources. Coprostanol concentrations ranged from &lt;4 up to 8930ngg-1 of dry weight sediment with higher values being observed in the area next to the Itajaí Harbor and under influence of Itajaí-Mirim River flow, which receives wastewater from several cities. Concentrations and selected sterol ratios were useful tools used to distinguish anthropogenic and biogenic organic matter (OM) sources in the studied area, where coprostanol concentrations higher than 500ngg-1 were observed in 42% of the stations analyzed, indicating strong sewage contamination. Factor analysis with principal component analysis (FA/PCA) has distinguished two different groups of samples, with high and low total sterol concentrations. FA/PCA results revealed that the stations located in the estuary were separated by PC1 because they are clearly contaminated by sewage, also pointed by coprostanol/(coprostanol+cholestanol) and coprostanol/cholesterol ratios and by the higher concentrations of fecal sterols. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Assessment of anthropogenic contamination with sterol markers in surface sediments of a tropical estuary (Itajaí-Açu, Brazil)","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2016"

"85089199336","Located in the Brazilian continental shelf, the so called ""Pre-Salt"" reservoirs with large accumulations of excellent quality, high commercial value light oil have become the most strategic oil production site for Brazil. One of the main challenges that has recently arisen concerns the definition of an adequate process to address the high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) presented in their geological formations. For the Pre-Salt basin, several options of offshore carbon dioxide storage have been studied, such as: aquifers, depleted reservoirs, and salt caverns. Although a mined offshore salt cavern has never been constructed, its adoption has been gaining momentum due to the mantle origin of CO2, the thickness of rock layer above the salt layer, and the lack of reservoirs below the carbonate reservoirs capable to store gases. Because of its unprecedent characteristics, the development of such facility implies a series of challenges in terms of safety and integrity aspects. Using tailored qualitative risk management tools, this paper explores the many aspects and interdependencies of well design, well clustering configuration, drilling, solution mining, CO2 disposal, and abandonment phases related to offshore salt caverns. The results obtained so far indicated that, technically, they are a feasible solution for Pre-Salt CO2 storage. However, economic and environmental viability strongly depends on well clustering configuration and solution mining process. © 2019 European Safety and Reliability Association.

"33646035823","The rupture of a pipeline transporting hydrocarbons at high temperature caused the spill of 1,300 m3 of fuel oil near the Guanabara Bay shoreline, on January 18, 2000. Immediately after the accident, an emergency effort was undertaken to obtain satellite images in order to monitor the spill's location and movement. One Landsat-5/TM (Thematic Mapper) and 15 Radarsat-1 images were acquired. This paper describes the results obtained with the interpretation of the first three images acquired after the spill. The low frequency of acquisition and the prevailing cloud cover limited the use of visible and infrared spaceborne sensors. Image processing techniques were applied to highlight oil-covered areas on the water surface. Ambiguities in the oil detection were resolved with the aid of ancillary information such as location of knows sources of pollution; aerial inspection information and OPS controlled aerial photos taken from helicopters. The RADARSAT-1 images show clearly the area affected by the spill accident allowing the differentiation of oil-free water areas, fluvial discharge or effluents areas, and oil-covered water areas. One limitation to oil detection using the Landsat-5/TM image was the presence of clouds and haze near the spilled area. In order to improve the visual discrimination of patterns on the water surface related to oil, many RGB combinations of the seven TM bands were evaluated. A supervised classification procedure was applied resulting in the following classes: oil-free water, fluvial discharge, bay areas affected by haze and oil-covered water. The CIS integration of the classification results with ancillary information, such as location of knows sources of pollution; aerial inspection information and GPS controlled aerial photos acquired simultaneously with image acquisition, allowed the final selection of oil-covered areas. The results obtained helped PETROBRAS to optimize the emergency response procedures and subsequent cleaning efforts.","Application of remote sensing data for oil spill monitoring in the Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",NULL,True,"2005"

Intensive farming conditions may cause physiological stress to the cultured organism, which can be evaluated by citogenotoxic biomarkers. The aim of this study was to assess the genotoxic effect of the rearing conditions in red blood cells of juvenile cobia Rachycentron canadum by using comet assay and micronucleus and other nuclear abnormalities assay. Juvenile cobia were reared for 13 weeks in indoor tank with open water circulation and in near shore cage. The comet assay and the nuclear abnormalities assay detected higher DNA damage and higher nuclear abnormalities frequency in erythrocytes of fish reared in the indoor tank. Results showed that two methods are complementary. Additionally, cobia were injected with ß-naphthoflavone (BNF) at concentrations of 2mgkg-1 and 10mgkg-1 in laboratory controlled conditions, and maintained for 7 days in separate tanks to better understand the response mechanisms of this species to a toxic substance. The comet assay did not detect any significant differences between BNF injected and control fish, whereas nuclear abnormalities assay showed significant differences between BNF injected and the control groups. The damages identified by the comet assay are repairable breaks in the DNA strands, whereas nuclear abnormalities may be permanent. Possibly the period of maintenance after injection was enough to clean BNF from the organisms and to repair the breaks in the DNA strands. As cobia seems to respond very well to genotoxic elements, comet assay and nuclear abnormalities assay would be useful tools to monitor farming conditions. © 2018, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

This paper presents an overview of the remediation program for Ponto 0, and draws preliminary conclusions regarding the efficacy of different remediation technologies. The major remediation technologies are: 1) injection and recovery trenches for free-product recovery in the sector adjacent to the spill site; 2) in situ bioremediation along the floodplain of Arroio Saldanha; and 3) a treatment wetland near the discharge of Arroio Saldanha into Rio Barigüi. The trenches appear to have removed most of the free product from the sector adjacent to the spill site. There is preliminary evidence, based on soil monitoring data, for the efficacy of in situ bioremediation, but further data will be required before a firm conclusion can be drawn. The treatment wetland was successful in restoring wetland vegetation (an essential component of this technology), and appears to be capable of removing hydrocarbons from groundwater.

A group of VLCC hulls was converted to FPSO, with the installation of oil process plants, turrets and so on. The internal conversion solves the questions about the processing, the storage and the oil offloading, but the external hull was not properly designed to respond to the waves, currents and the wind as a stationary unit. Many studies have been more recently developed to discuss the stability of this kind of system, the use of spreading mooring system with different tensions on the lines, the use and the position of a turret, the use of stabilization devices, as doubled rudder, propeller, tugs, etc...

The stability problem is formulated in a similar approach as in Sphaier, Fernandes and Correa (1999 and 2000b). But, instead of verifying the stability of the system from known hydrodynamic coefficients, the analytical expression for the eigenvalues is developed as a function of the main dimensions of the floating unit.

The aim was to investigate the link between the prevailing regional specific oceanographic conditions (upwelling events, intrusion of cold and nutrient-rich water, low river input) and the nature and distribution of organic matter (OM) in the basin. A general predominance of OM from autochthonous processes, but with a relevant spatial gradient in the quality and quantity of the sedimentary OM, was observed. On the shelf (&lt;150 m), concentrations of lipids were usually low, except in areas influenced by upwelling, but the presence of labile compounds suggested the occurrence of fresh OM in the sediment. The export of continental OM was observed only in shelf sediments near the Paraíba do Sul River. The upper and middle slope (400–1300 m) exhibited the highest concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC) and lipids, but lipid biomarkers suggested the presence of OM with a high degree of bacterial degradation. This may result from the export of material from shallow areas, possibly due to the action of eddies and meandering of the Brazil Current and bottom currents in the region. On the lower slope (1900–3000 m), only the more recalcitrant compounds were above detection limit. The presence of labile lipids in high amount in the shelf and slope suggests the presence of OM with a high potential for supplying the food requirements of heterotrophic organisms in the sediment, which may in turn have a major influence on the ecology of benthic communities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Organic matter in sediments of a tropical and upwelling influenced region of the Brazilian continental margin (Campos Basin, Rio de Janeiro)","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2018"
"85074632793","Fourteen years (September 2002 to August 2016) of high-resolution satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) data are used to describe the frontal pattern and frontogenesis on the southeastern continental shelf of Brazil. The daily SST fronts are obtained using an edge-detection algorithm, and the monthly frontal probability (FP) is subsequently calculated. High SST FPs are mainly distributed along the coast and decrease with distance from the coastline. The results from empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decompositions reveal strong seasonal variability of the coastal SST FP with maximum (minimum) in the astral summer (winter). Wind plays an important role in driving the frontal activities, and high FPs are accompanied by strong alongshore wind stress and wind stress curl. This is particularly true during the summer, when the total transport induced by the alongshore component of upwelling-favorable winds and the wind stress curl reaches the annual maximum. The fronts are influenced by multiple factors other than wind forcing, such as the orientation of the coastline, the seafloor topography, and the meandering of the Brazil Current. As a result, there is a slight difference between the seasonality of the SST fronts and the wind, and their relationship was varying with spatial locations. The impact of the air-sea interaction is further investigated in the frontal zone, and large coupling coefficients are found between the crosswind (downwind) SST gradients and the wind stress curl (divergence). The analysis of the SST fronts and wind leads to a better understanding of the dynamics and frontogenesis off the southeastern continental shelf of Brazil, and the results can be used to further understand the air-sea coupling process at regional level. © 2019, The Author(s).","Seasonal variability of SST fronts and winds on the southeastern continental shelf of Brazil","Springer Verlag",True,"2019"
"84947757002","By monitoring the variation of weights of floating production units (FPUs), the sum of total weight computed by load calculators on board very often does not match the actual displacement based on the current drafts. Differences can also be observed in the trim and heel of FPUs, which present values different from zero degree in the calculations, but in fact they are frequently kept near zero by ballast control. The mooring lines and risers tensions are one of the most uncertain weight items in loading conditions reported by the crew on board, therefore, this paper aims to assess the influence and behavior of these systems to a variety of situations in which FPUs operate. Analyses were performed for semi-submersibles and FPSOs considering two configurations of mooring system: catenary and taut-leg. The purpose is to evaluate how the magnitude of the resulting force varies-and hence how the trim and heel change-for a range of offsets caused by environmental conditions. The effect of mooring lines and risers is also discussed regarding the water depth by means of case studies considering a range of water depths. Actual lines properties and seabed bathymetry from mooring system models of platforms located offshore Brazil have been taken as reference. In short, the mooring lines and risers loads will be calculated for different types of floating production units, mooring system configurations and water depths in order to evaluate their influence on the trim, heel and displacement of FPUs.","Influence of mooring lines and risers on the trim, heel and displacement on fpus","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)",True,"2015"
"85101493235","The rift phase of the Campos Basin developed during the Early Cretaceous on a heterogeneous crust comprising structures inherited from the Brasiliano-Pan African tectonic events, mostly generated during the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian amalgamation of western Gondwana blocks. The main rifting episode took place from the Hauterivian to the Barremian, then was succeeded by the transition and post-rift (SAG) phases during the Aptian. Rift faults developed as a result of a progressive rotation of extension from E-W to NW-SE. The role of pre-existing intra-basement structures on the style and evolution of the rift faults was investigated using 3D high-resolution seismic data, borehole logs and sidewall samples. Three seismic facies (SF1, SF2 and SF3) and three types of intra-basement structures (Surfaces, Geobodies and Internal Reflections) were identified and mapped. They represent, respectively, contrasting levels of seismic anisotropy, interpreted as metamorphic foliation, and ductile shear zones that bound rock units with particular seismic facies signatures. Sidewall cores show that banded biotite-gneiss is the predominant rock type in the eastern half of the study area, while more homogeneous granitoid is the dominant lithology on the west. Such a binary division of lithotypes is consistent with the distribution of mapped intra-basement seismic facies and features. The contrasting basement heterogeneity across the study area is the major control in the strain distribution during rifting. Where the basement is highly heterogeneous, the pre-existing fabric was selectively reactivated whenever its orientation was favourable, resulting in faults forming progressively as the extension direction rotates, whilst shallower low to very low angle basement fabric were cross-cut by rift faults. Where the basement is homogeneous, only early formed faults remain active throughout the rifting. © 2021 The Authors.

"85096519364","Wave-dominated nearshore deposits are commonly regarded as laterally-continuous, homogeneous, sheet-like reservoirs that can be resolved at the parasequence scale. Many reservoirs, however, have an internal complexity that becomes clearer during production, indicating unexpected internal compartmentalization. Modern wave-dominated nearshore environments are extremely variable due to the effects of allogenic and autogenic processes. Relative sea-level change and shoreline trajectory has been indicated as key controlling factors on the distribution of sand in Quaternary coastal systems worldwide. In this paper we use 3D seismic data to describe the geomorphology of buried, Campanian and Eocene wave-dominated coastal deposits in two stratigraphic intervals within shelf-margin clinoforms in the Santos Basin, SE offshore Brazil. By applying seismic attributes and comparison with modern analogues we interpret the paleoenvironments and correlate them with well-log motifs and styles of shelf-margin trajectories in order to discuss the balance of allogenic and autogenic controls on nearshore reservoir heterogeneity. The sand-rich nearshore deposits appear in the seismic data as distinct topset amplitude anomalies recording shoreline transit across the shelf. The Campanian interval comprises reflectors formed in a predominantly normal-regressive context, while the Eocene interval depicts partially-eroded topset reflectors associated with forced regressions and retrograding reflectors associated with transgressions. Nearshore seismic-geomorphic elements were grouped in associations of strandplains, barrier islands/spits and lagoons, and partially-eroded nearshore. Strandplains are related sub-horizontal to ascending regressive clinoform trajectories where wider strandplains are associated with sub-horizontal trajectories. Nearshore erosion and fluvial incision are associated with descending trajectories within forced regressions, while barrier islands/spits and lagoons are associated with transgressive trends. Transgressive trajectories generated coastal systems with high mud content and discontinuous sand bodies along strike and dip, while forced regressions resulted in sand-rich systems that are complex and highly compartmentalized by subaerial erosion. The most attractive reservoirs are associated with normal-regressive intervals under low rates of relative-sea level rise, forming relatively homogeneous sand-rich strandplains. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Subsurface geomorphology of wave-dominated nearshore deposits: Contrasting styles of reservoir heterogeneity in response to shoreline trajectory","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2021"
"84892632570","In any new drilling project, the main objective is always to maximize return on investment. New technologies continue to be developed and used in an effort to enhance production and reservoir recovery. In this context, multilateral systems is one of the technologies that has experience significant development and application in onshore and offshore oil drilling projects in recent years. In multilateral systems, two or more horizontal wellbores are drilled from single parent wellbore, enabling drainage of multiple reservoir targets. Many are the benefits from the application of multilateral technology such as production of non-explored reserves located near existing wells and efficient reservoir drainage. Although the obvious advantages, multilateral systems are still a technology in development stage and as such have limitations. One of the critical problems directly impacting risk and the economical viability of a project is the reliability of equipments, operations, and the human performance and interaction with multilateral systems. Petrobras, the Brazilian oil company, has been progressively adopting multilateral technology for onshore and offshore drilling projects. Aware of the criticality of reliability aspects to the risk of drilling operations in terms of possible loss of the main wellbore due to drilling problems, an intensive research work has been undertaken in that direction. In this paper, we present and discuss a methodology for probability assessment of the construction process of multilateral wells. The methodology is hybrid in nature, i.e., it combines the use of event and fault trees with Bayesian belief networks. The construction process of multilateral wells is characterized by the use of sophisticated equipments, complex operations, and human-machine interaction. As such, the construction process is initially broken down into twenty three main phases and then analyzed by means of Hierarchical Task Analysis in order to characterize the human-human and human-machine interactions. Next, event sequence diagrams are developed where the pivotal events correspond to equipment failures as well as human errors. In order to overcome typical limitations of second generation human reliability models such as unrealistic independence assumption among events, the hybrid methodology employs a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) approach to model and quantify the probability of human error in performing multilateral related activities. The resulting BBN models not only depict the cause and effect relationship among human operators, but also the relevant performance shaping factors as well as related equipment failure for a given multilateral operation. © 2006 by ASME.","Probability assessment of offshore oil multilateral wells construction process in Brazil",NULL,True,"2006"
"85079351203","Circular to elliptical topographic depressions, isolated or organized in trails, have been observed on the modern seabed in different contexts and water depths. Such features have been alternatively interpreted as pockmarks generated by fluid flow, as sediment waves generated by turbidity currents, or as a combination of both processes. In the latter case, the dip of the slope has been hypothesized to control the formation of trails of downslope migrating pockmarks. In this study, we use high-quality 3D seismic data from the offshore Ceará Basin (Equatorial Brazil) to examine vertically stacked and upslope-migrating trails of depressions visible at the seabed and in the subsurface. Seismic reflection terminations and stratal architecture indicate that these features are formed by cyclic steps generated by turbidity currents, while internal amplitude anomalies point to the presence of fluid migration. Amplitude Versus Offset analysis (AVO) performed on partial stacks shows that the investigated anomalies do not represent hydrocarbon indicators. Previous studies have suggested that the accumulation of permeable and porous sediments in the troughs of vertically stacked cyclic steps may create vertical pathways for fluid migration, and we propose that this may have facilitated the upward migration of saline pore water due to fluid buoyancy. The results of this study highlight the importance of gravity-driven processes in shaping the morphology of the Ceará Basin slope and show how non-hydrocarbon fluids may interact with vertically stacked cyclic steps. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Characterisation of submarine depression trails driven by upslope migrating cyclic steps: Insights from the Ceará Basin (Brazil)","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2020"
"17344364742","In 2004, after a cycle of 11 yr in which the annual increase in crude oil production was 8.6% avg, the production decreased 3%, according to Petrobras. In 2003, the production was 1.54 million bpd avg. The decline in production was due to delays in construction and the arrival of two Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels, the P-43 and P-48. The P-43 began to process crude oil on 12/22/2004. When the P-48 enters service, Petrobras will be able to increase its production of crude oil by 500,000 bpd. The P-43 is stationed in the Barracuda field, bay of Campos, offshore the state of Rio de Janeiro, in 800 m of water. Initial oil yield is 10,380 bpd of 25° gravity. Platform P-48, the twin of P-43, is part of the Barracuda-Caratinga project that will increase Petrobras crude oil production by 300,000 bpd. This platform will enter service in January 2005. With the new capacity, the production of crude oil by Petrobras is expected to reach 1.9 million bpd by the end of 2005. Other floating installations will contribute as well when they enter service, the P-50 and P-34. Petrobras is to invest $26,200 million until 2010 for E&P. Between 2005 and 2008, 17 installations will enter service allowing annual increases of 5.9% in production of crude oil and NGL, achieving self sufficiency in 2006. Petrobras has invested heavily in improved recovery that in the last 10 yr in the Marlim oilfield has yielded an additional increment of 3000 million bbl of crude oil. In November 2004 Petrobras gave a $47 million contract to the Western Geco company to make a three dimensional seismic study of the Marlim basin to identify reserves there. Discovery of an additional 290 million bbl of crude oil in Marlim is expected. On dry land, improved recovery enabled an increment of 200,000 bpd in production from the fields in the states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe in 2004. In 2006-2007, the company expects to substitute for imports of light crude oil its own production to start in the oilfield offshore the state of Espírito Santo. This is lighter crude oil than that from the bay of Campos where the company now obtains 80% of its oil production. The Brazilian oilfields produce mainly heavy crude oil that has to be mixed with lighter imported crude oil to produce quality gasoline. However, Brazil increases its exports of heavy crude oil. The company is involved in new areas of exploration. They are discussed.

This study assessed PCBs and OCPs in surface sediments of two estuaries with distinct historical land use on the coast of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. OCPs such as HCB, aldrin, dieldrin, isodrin, mirex, methoxychlor, endosulfans (α- and β-isomers), HCHs (α-, β-, γ- and δ-isomers) and chlordane-related compounds were below their respective limits of detection in all samples. Mean levels of PCBs in Pina Sound and Suape Estuary were 4.37 and 0.94 ng g-1 dry weight (dw), respectively. Average concentrations of DDTs in those same estuaries were 5.24 and 0.42 ng g-1 dw, respectively. No significant correlations were found between mud and contaminants (either PCBs or DDTs) at Pina Sound. In contrast, PCBs were significantly associated with mud at Suape Estuary. The greater contamination found at Pina Sound is consistent with land use of the urban, densely populated city of Recife. Residues of DDTs found in sediments of both estuaries reflect past local usage. Occasional adverse biological effects may be expected due to the levels of DDTs at several sites in Pina Sound. Lower levels of chemicals such as PCBs in the newly industrialized Suape Estuary suggest that a similarly low impact of legacy pollutants may be expected for future industrial enterprises around the world. © 2018, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

"85066600751","Offshore oil production with the employment of FPSOs (Floating, Production, Storage and Offloading) unit faces the challenge of increasing well volumes, processing and storage capacity and ultimately oil offloading and transportation. Following the natural activity development in some oil fields, the number of spread-moored FPSOs and the employment of Dynamic Positioning Shuttle Tankers increased, however represent altogether a bottleneck for the production capacity and considerable transportation cost increment. The need to implement alternatives for the use of larger and conventional tankers is evident, and several attempts and use of technology are being tested and proposed. The work presents preliminary numerical and cost analysis of an innovative Oil Loading Terminal (OLT) for deep water. Based on field data, metocean studies and extensive practical experience, the OLT should allow direct offloading from the FPSOs onto conventional shuttle tankers including VLCCs. The OLT concept allows the transfer of oil from an FPSO to a conventional tanker moored in CALM Buoy through submerged oil offloading lines (OOLs) supported by a tethered submerged buoy. The conventional tanker will receive the oil through a floating hose string. The cornerstone of this OLT concept is the subsurface buoy application to support the OLLs and consequently de-coupling the FPSO and CALM Buoy motions simultaneously. As a result, the OOLs loads and fatigue efforts under the CALM Buoy also decrease. The paper evaluates an OLT specific conception for the Brazilian offshore pre-salt area and results related to the numerical analysis carried out are presented considering one submerged buoy connected to a FPSO and CALM Buoy via flexible offloading lines respectively. The results appoint to a technically feasible solution that can be complementarily laboratory and field tested. Further, the solution cost impact has been assessed and initial figures demonstrate that the final testing, construction and installation of one system will need investment that cost a fraction of tanker lifting costs currently requiring Ship-to-Ship oil transfers. The economies assessed with the use of this innovative solution include total avoidance of Ship-to-Ship costs; cuts transportation cost per ton in up to 50% (fifty percent), eliminates offloading bottlenecks allowing better use of FPSO storage and plant processing capacity, and ultimately decreases the number of tanker offloading operations with considerable benefit to operational safety by reducing risk exposure.

"345171568","The SCR (Steel Catenary Riser) was adopted by Petrobras as a cost-effective alternative for oil and gas export lines on deepwater fields, where large diameter flexible risers present technical and economic limitations. The SCR structures are subjected to several types of loads during their service life. These loads may be static or dynamic. When installed, the action of environmental phenomena like wind, current and sea waves on the floating unit, induces motions that will be transferred to the riser top connection. The random time domain dynamic analysis approach is considered to be more suitable to represent the loads and also die structural response due to the capability to represent existing non-linearities in the model. The sea-state spectra are treated by a time-simulation method, so fluid load non-linearity and fluid-structure interaction are well represented. Structural non-linearity, drag forces, fluid-structure relative velocity, and sea surface level variations are also taken into account. The fatigue damage calculation is directly related with stresses ranges composed along the whole structure service life. The load sets used in such analysis should be complete enough to represent all possible significant situations. This procedure results in a high computer time consuming necessary for several time-domain analyses, that is not compatible with a typical design schedule. Therefore, the load cases have to be reduced without lack of accuracy or safety. This paper presents the approach and methodology adopted in Petrobras to verify the SCR fatigue damage. The analysis performed and presented used the Petrobras's in-house computer codes ANFLEX and POSFAL, which were specially upgraded for this purpose.","Fatigue damage verification of steel catenary risers","American Society of Mechanical Engineers(ASME)",True,"2001"

"84894453276","Brazilian carbonate reservoirs contain huge oil-in-place volumes and are likely to have an important economic impact in global oil industry. Such carbonate reservoirs, both Albian and Aptian, are located offshore in deep water, which has an important role in development costs. In siliciclastic plays it is standard practice to use time-lapse (4D) seismic to locate wells in unswept areas, maximizing the recovery factor. However, in carbonate plays, time-lapse seismic monitoring remains challenging, with few cases of success published around the world. Carbonates differ from siliciclastic rocks in many aspects. With a varied chemical composition and complex pore connectivity, carbonates bring on a large diversity of facies, each one showing a specific seismic response. Moreover, the usually high incompressibility of the carbonate matrix reduces sensitivity to pressure and saturation changes, which are the main effects expected on a hydrocarbon field undergoing production. Considering both the economic relevance and the difficulties of using time-lapse seismic to monitor carbonate reservoirs, Petrobras created a strategic program to face this challenge, a time-lapse seismic (S4D) study of an Albian carbonate reservoir located in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. Three legacy data were available: streamer-1987, streamer-2002, and ocean-bottom cable-2010. Extensive feasibility studies are performed as well as a meticulous prestack 4D simultaneous inversion based on the seismic data, preliminary cross-equalized to partially overcome the initial low repeatability. A multidisciplinary interpretation conducted by a team of geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers finally lead to results overcoming expectations. Saturation and pressure changes are detected using P-and S-impedance attributes, consistent with production data. Results are opening perspectives for further monitoring other carbonate reservoirs, especially with new presalt Brazilian discoveries in the Campos and Santos Basins, which might have a huge economic impact. © 2014 © 2014 by The Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","Brazilian carbonate reservoir: A successful seismic time-lapse monitoring study","Society of Exploration Geophysicists",True,"2014"

"84865723570","Mega oil and gas reservoirs have been discovered in deep and ultra-deep offshore Brazil. These Pre-Salt discoveries are remotely located at water depths ranging from 2200m (∼7,200 ft) to 2600 m (∼8,500 ft). Offshore Brazil has unique metocean conditions with long swell periods which present challenges on floating platforms such as Spars and Semis. In addition, the remoteness of location and the associated high cost of vessel mobilization add further pressure on economics and risk. Quayside integration is thus a desired feature of the hull concept in order to eliminate offshore mating and the associated risk to cost and schedule. To explore these pre-salt complicated ultra-deepwater reservoirs usually require large drilling rig and drilling variable payload which result in very large topsides in both size and weight. Spars and TLPs are the only two proven dry tree hull forms in deep and ultra-deep waters in the GOM. However the TLP becomes cost prohibitive if the water depth is beyond 1,524 m (5,000 ft). For large payload systems requiring a large drilling rig, a suitable Spar size creates a challenge for transportation and installation. The semi-submersible hull form is known to offer advantages over Spars such as larger deck space and quayside integration which are essential to reducing offshore commissioning time and risk as well as cost and schedule.

"85085774766","This work aims to present a review of dielectric logging, including physical principles, petrophysical evaluation, and applications. In addition, we will present a history of its use in Petrobras oilfields. The dielectric properties are generated by the charge alignment created by an excitation provided by an electric field. In this sense, polar characteristics of water molecules allow quantification of volume of water present in the reservoir, independently of salinity. Owing to the shallow depths of investigation, dielectric tools are useful in evaluating residual oil in high uncertainty salinity conditions, especially in mature fields, where uncertainties occur due to injection of water and/or steam. Although this logging tool has a long history of use in the petroleum industry, it was rarely used in Petrobras oilfields due to the high specificity, limitations of the technique, and/or high cost. Considering high frequencies used and proximity between electrodes, the tool provides very shallow measurements, which makes it impossible to evaluate the virgin zone in most reservoirs. Due to these characteristics, the tool was widely employed in low mobility hydrocarbon formations, where mud filtrate invasion tends to be smaller. The dielectric tool was used in Petrobras to evaluate reservoirs with very high viscosity and fresh water, in which it showed good results in the quantification of water saturation and hydrocarbon mobility. Additionally, the tool was used in Pre-salt in order to evaluate residual oil saturation to diminish the uncertain of microresistivity logs. Besides evaluating water saturation, many works have shown other applications for dielectric logging, such as to determine conductivity, salinity, wettability, Archie's ""m"" and ""n"" electric parameters, CEC, and evaluation of laminated reservoirs. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Dielectric logging: Principles, applications, and examples from the Brazilian oilfields","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"

The oil discharged into the Barigüi River, a tributary of the Iguassu River. It's estimated that twenty per cent of all the oil spilled volatilized. After running along the creek and its wetlands, the oil contaminated 6 kilometers of the Barigiii River and 60 kilometers of the Iguassu River.

Helicopters, trucks, oil recovering boats, light boats, mechanical excavators, dredgers and 3,200 meters of retention booms were used. Roads and accesses were reformed or built. The overall emergency response effort proved to be successful; in nine days, all of the free oil was removed from the rivers. The cleaning of the riverbanks and inundation areas was completed in three months. The Saldanha Creek and the four wetlands areas upgradient of the Bangui River retained approximately 70 per cent of all of the oil spilled, all superficial oil was removed until it could not move superficially, the remaining oil impregnated in the upper soil profiles. Since then, various remediation techniques were implemented to remediate both, soil surface water and groundwater. The upper portion of the soil profile is remediated with bioremediation, using natural indigenous microorganism. This technique consists in cultivating the soil with mechanical agricultural equipment or manuallv where accessibility does not allow the use of mechanical equipment. Nutrients and other amendments can be added when required. In some cases soil are bioaugmented with microorganisms of the ""landfarming"" cells of the refinery. This technique is a variant of the landfarming technique that has been studied at the Repar (Refinaria Presidente Getúlio Vargas) refinery for more than ten years. Such technique has proven to be more efficient than traditional landfarming. The soil below 40 centimeters cannot be remediated with this technique. Soils at such depth are being recovered through a series of drainage and injection trenches. Water injected in the injection trench forces the free and trapped oil to move laterally to the recovery trenches.

The field is operated by Petrobras having Chevron as non-operator partner. Papa Terra has a crude oil with an API index between 14 and 17 degrees. The field is among one of the most complex subsea developments ever executed in Brazil with its first oil performed in 2013 and the production subsea facilities installation completed in 2014. The proposed design for the subsea production system was the use of an Electrically Trace Heated Integrated Production Bundle (ETH-IPB), the 3rd generation of this field proven technology, which was successfully designed, manufactured and installed by Technip on previous West African projects. A total of 27 km of ETH-IPB riser and flowline as well as its own electrical and monitoring module have been designed, manufactured, installed and successfully commissioned for the Papa Terra project. The core of the ETH-IPB is a 6 ID flexible pipe dedicated to production fluid. Around the core, the following components are distributed into a bundle layer: Heat tracing cables designed to provide active heating of the production fluid during warm up or after a shut-down. A Distributed Temperature Sensor (DTS) fiber optic system, deployed offshore into a stainless steel tube loop in order to provide temperature monitoring along the length of the riser and flowline system. Spacers, designed to protect the electrical cables and fiber optic tubes from mechanical loadings during installation and manufacturing. The main aim of this paper is to describe the design of this production system, that was used for the first time in Brazil and which present a lot of innovations in several domains, due to overall length, thermal requirements, heating control and riser to flowline electrical connection on the seabed. Some results of the qualification program will be presented, in particular mechanical, bundle components, fatigue and thermal performance tests. Finally, results of the field performance tests and operational feedback by Petrobras will be presented and discussed.

However, the micropaleontological data of the Pelotas Basin is mainly concerning to calcareous microfossils, which is not true for the sedimentary deposits of the Pelotas Basin, whose micropaleontological informations is mostly referring by calcareous microfossils. In this second contribution, we present the systematic and descriptive detailing of the dinoflagellates cysts of the Ptychodiscales and Gonyaulacales orders, from the analysis of 535 samples collected from two wells (BP-01 and BP-02) drilled by Petrobras S.A. in the offshore portion of the Pelotas Basin. The levels analyzed are rich and diverse, enabling the recognition of 137 species. In greater numbers, cysts belonging to the Order Gonyaulacales include 76 genera, 133 species, besides three sub-species. Two genera and four species were assigned to the Order Ptychodiscales. Among the described taxa, 72 are cited for the first time for the Brazilian basins. The recognized associations indicated ages between the Cretaceous and the Neogene, based on the occurrences of E. dettmanniae, D. acuminatum and O. indigena for the Cretaceous; D. californica, D. carposphaeropsis and E. reticulata for the Paleocene; B. longissimum, M. fimbriatum and M. perforatum for the Eocene; C. galea, C. aubryae and H. obscura for the Miocene.

The Archipelago is divided into three main units: Pico das Gaivotas Unit (i) is made up of nosean-phonolite and phono-tephrite domes and tephri-phonolite dykes with clinopyroxene, nosean and potassic feldspar phenocrysts, and scarce kaersutite anhedral phenocrysts; the Bandeira Unit (ii), in turn, comprises melanephelinitic and basanitic lava flows with olivine and clinopyroxene (diopside) phenocrysts; and lastly, the Basal Unit (iii) is composed of pyroclastic deposits with tuffs, lapilli-tuffs and lapillite. The clinopyroxene phenocrysts from Pico das Gaivotas and Bandeira Units have anhedral green cores with sieved and poikilitic textures and show reaction rims composed of opaque minerals, indicating disequilibrium and compositional changes in the liquid. This study provides mineral chemistry data indicating that clinopyroxene rims are more primitive (Mg# 57.46–84.12) and enriched in Al–Ti–Fe3+-Ca compared to the Fe-rich green-cores, probably related with a more primitive Ca-rich magma input in the magmatic chamber after the green-core crystallization from a different liquid. Olivine crystals from Bandeira Unit show resorption features and no compositional affinity with the analyzed liquid, indicating that these crystals have a xenocrystic origin from mantle peridotitic source. Clinopyroxene geothermobarometry data suggest different pressure and temperature conditions for cores and rims during crystallization, reflecting a polybaric evolutionary history.

"84864936265","Whole-rock geochemistry, combined with Sr-Nd isotopic composition of pelitic sedimentary rocks, have been considered to be useful parameters to estimate not only their provenance but also to make inferences about their depositional environment as well as the weathering processes they have been through. The basal sedimentary units of the basins of the northeastern Brazilian continental margin, particularly those of the pre-rift sequence, have been subject of interest of studies based on chemical and isotopic data, since they lack fossil content to establish their age and, therefore, stratigraphic correlations are difficult. The major and trace element contents as well as Sr-Nd isotopic compositions of whole-rock shale samples from five outcrops attributed to the pre-rift supersequence of the Camamu Basin were analyzed with the purpose of characterizing and obtaining further information that would allow a better correlation between the sites studied. The geochemical data suggest that the rocks exposed in the studied outcrops are part of the same sedimentary unit and that they might be correlated to the Capianga Member of the Aliança Formation of the Recôncavo Basin, exposed to the north of the Camamu Basin. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) suggests conditions associated with a humid tropical/subtropical climate at the time of deposition. Nd isotopic compositions indicate provenance from the Paleoproterozoic rocks of the Sao Francisco craton. The results presented here, therefore, show that the combined use of chemical and isotopic analyses may be of great interest to characterize and correlate lithologically homogeneous clastic sedimentary sequences. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Whole-rock geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotopic composition of the pre-rift sequence of the Camamu Basin, northeastern Brazil",NULL,True,"2012"
"85075835330","Oil offshore Brazil, as well as in other continents, has demanded floating units for oil production. Typical anchored production units are the semi-submersible platforms, FPSO, Spar Buoys and TLPs. All of them use several anchoring lines for station keeping. In the offshore Brazil scenario, the last twelve years the FPSOs adopts the torpedo piles and polyester ropes in the anchoring lines in deep and ultra-deep waters. The FPSO “Cidade de Angra dos Reis” was the first to operate in pre-salt area in October 2010. From then on, it became common the production units with VLCC size, oil production of 150,000 barrels per day and 24 anchoring lines. The reason for such large number of anchors is the 1,200 tonnes torpedo piles holding power restriction. The proposition developed in this paper reduces the number of anchor lines using well know offshore equipment such as: driven piles, mooring chains, polyester ropes and conventional anchoring deck equipment. The main difference is the use of driven piles with holding power above 1,800 tonnes and anchor lines with a breaking strength of more than 2,000 tonnes. It is shown that a decrease of number of anchoring lines from 24 to 12 can be achieved. Consequently, it will decrease also the space occupied by the anchoring lines in the seabed by reducing the subsea layout of risers, flow lines and well head. This allows a technical and economical scenario more feasible when compared with the currently used on the Brazilian oil & gas market.

"85055036761","The Albacora field, located in Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, was discovered by PETROBRÁS in 1984. Following the discovery, a 7000Km 3-D survey was recorded, in the search for a better understanding of the field. At least three distinct families of reservoirs were identified in the area, ranging in age from Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) to Miocene. The reservoirs are turbidites of two basic types: loose sands with a complex areal distribution, in the Tertiary accumulations; and more cemented sandstones, with a simpler distribution, in the Cretaceous accumulation. In a great part of the area, the reservoirs are interbedded with higher acoustic impedance rocks. The clear 3-D seismic definition of the reservoirs, as a rule, allows a detailed stratigraphic (as well as structural) interpretation. For the Oligocene and Miocene pools, seismic amplitude mapping, carried out in an interactive workstation, provided a surprisingly good picture of the turbidites distribution, considering the target depths (236D-2645m). Most well locations in the field, after the 3-D interpretation, were chosen with the help of the seismic amplitude maps. Special geologic features, such as channel facies and lobe-type deposits, were identified on the amplitude maps, and later confirmed by core and well log data interpretation. © 1996-2018 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

The seismic surveys reveal the widespread distribution of incised valleys of different size in offshore continuation of the present-day Parnaiba delta. According to morphology two channel types can be distinguished: U-shaped channels in the eastern part and V-shaped channels in the western part. The stratigraphic successions were grouped into four seismic units separated by different seismic boundaries. The characteristics of the seismic boundaries and internal reflectors of the seismic units were used to distinguish between marine and riverine deposits. The incised-valleys architectural elements were used to link sedimentation processes and variations in base level from late Pleistocene channel avulsion and channel infill in the lowermost course of the paleo-Parnaíba River to marine sediments of the present-day inner shelf.

"85075828327","One of the main challenges in rigid riser design for Brazilian Pre-salt is the fatigue limit state. At this new production frontier, some key points are imposed as a challenge for riser designers, mainly due to the high level of motions imposed by the FPSO at the riser top in a coupled system with water depth around 2200 meters, and thicker riser's thermal insulation demanded for flow assurance (which worsens the dynamic response of production risers). Additionally, high contaminant levels in the fluid (CO2 &amp; H2S) demands CRA materials. Within this context, Petrobras has been considering Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) configuration as a base case scenario for rigid riser projects, since this configuration is able to absorb part of the FPSO motions that would reach the touch down zone (TDZ) and, consequently, making this region much less demanded when compared against Steel Catenary Risers (SCR). In its pioneer deepwater SLWR [1], Petrobras adopted a conservative approach for fatigue assessment that involved degenerated SN curves from DNV-RPC203, i.e. D curve in cathodic protection with the slope changing point (SCP) shifted to 5×106 for external wall and F1 curve in air with SCP at 5×107 for internal wall. More recently, both DNVGL and BSI have reviewed their fatigue assessment codes and no longer holds parity between SN curves. BS-7608 Ed. 2014 introduced different SCPs in order to account for a possible non-conservativeness in the assessment of low stresses under variable amplitude in the loading spectra. DNVGL-RP-C203 Ed. 2016 now presents three different bilinear SN curves for the internal wall of pipelines and risers that depends on weld misalignment, while it keeps SCP unchanged. This paper presents a recent case study for a typical SLWR configuration in pre-salt, in order to evaluate the impact of the changes proposed by the new versions of these design codes in the fatigue life of riser girth welds. Results of this work showed that the impact of different positioning of slope changing points in SN curves can have a great importance for riser design, since typical load spectrum lies around this region. Fatigue life could be increased up to twice or three times if one of these codes are adopted instead of the Shifted SN curves. However, the effect of low stresses under variable amplitude loading spectra is still a concern and it should be further investigated.

"84897465328","The Oil and Gas industry is currently investigating innovative solutions in order to develop new fields in deep-water, remote areas and to increase the recovery of mature fields. Subsea separation solutions enhance production while better managing hydrates (gas/liquid separation) or allow the debottlenecking of topside water treatment (water/hydrocarbon separation and subsea water re-injection). SAIPEM is currently developing several subsea separation systems made of pipes working in parallel: The MULTIPIPE for the subsea gas/liquid separation and the SPOOLSEP for subsea water/hydrocarbon separation. For each technology, the design is relying on flow split and operation of pipes in parallel. Extensive qualification tests were undertaken focusing on the symmetry of the system and its operability for subsea application. These separators with reduced wall thicknesses, compared to single large diameter vessels, are especially well suited to deep water and /or high pressure applications. Moreover these solutions are reliable as they rely on gravity separation and allow for standard manufacturing and installation procedures as well as conventional installation and maintenance vessels. The gas/liquid Multipipe separator has been qualified through several test campaigns, including a first JIP with tests with real crude under pressure to simulate subsea operation showing its versatility for deepwater application. A second JIP with Petrobras, Total and ENI has been completed early 2013. It has covered the qualification of the whole subsea station and the performance of additional flow performance tests. Further qualification actions including tests have been identified in view of some recent high pressure application cases. Following the positive results on the Multipipe Saipem has initiated the development of the water/hydrocarbon SpoolSep separator. The paper presents the results of the first qualification tests on separation performance which started early this year as well as the way forward which includes a JIP for the performance of tests with real crude.

"85012910163","Passive margins underlain by a salt detachment are typically interpreted as kinematically linked zones of updip extension and downdip contraction separated by a zone of translation above a smoothly dipping base of salt. However, salt flow is affected by the base-of-salt geometry across which it flows, and early-stage gravity gliding induced by basin tilt may be complicated by the presence of salt-thickness changes caused by the pre-existing base-salt relief. We investigate these effects using physical models. Dip-parallel steps generate strike-slip fault zones separating domains of differential downslope translation and structural styles, provided the overburden is thin enough. If the overburden is thicker, it resists breakup, but a change in the structural trend occurs across the step. Steps with mild obliquity to the dip direction produce transtensional and transpressional faults in the cover separating structural domains. Deformation complexity in the overburden increases where base-salt steps strike at a high angle to salt flow, and it is especially dependent on the ratio between the thick (T) and thin (t) salt across the step at the base of salt. Where the salt-thickness ratio (T/t) is high, basal drag generates major flux mismatches, resulting in a contractional thickening of the salt and associated overburden shortening in thin salt above a base-salt high block. Shortening is transient and superseded by extension as the salt thickening allows the flow velocity to increase. When transitioning off a base-salt high block into a low block, the greater flux within the thick salt results in a monocline with extensional and contractional hinges. Structures are further deformed as they translate through these hinge zones. Our physical models demonstrate that extensional diapirs and compressional fold belts can be initiated anywhere on a slope as the salt accelerates and decelerates across base-salt relief. A fold belt from the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, is used to illustrate these processes. © The Authors.","The effects of base-salt relief on salt flow and suprasalt deformation patterns - Part 1: Flow across simple steps in the base of salt","Society of Exploration Geophysicists",True,"2017"

"70449127482","In 2005, Petrobras created a corporate program named GeDIg, designed to guide and implement Digital Integrated Field Management among its production assets. The Barracuda and Caratinga (BRC) asset was chosen as one of Rio de Janeiro Business Unit pilots. This asset is composed of two offshore deep-water oil fields, where two twin FPSOs, P-43 and P-48, produce a total of approximately 200,000 bpd of oil, with an average density of 24° API. Management and technical teams from BRC are geographically dispersed among four different locations: the asset's headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, the logistics and operations base in Macae, a city located 190 km (118 miles) Northeast of Rio de Janeiro, and the two offshore production units, located about 160 km (100 miles) East of Macae. Collaborative environments (CE) were implemented in each site to connect and integrate those teams. The GeDIg-BRC pilot project, initiated in October 2006, was divided in five different areas: real time production operations monitoring, integrated planning, process design, change management, and collaborative environment design and construction. Also, during the earlier stages of the project, a business case was generated to identify, quantify and validate the expected benefits of the project. A major challenge faced during the implementation of the GeDIg-BRC solution, was making the whole integration proposed by the collaborative environments become a reality. The asset started using its collaborative environments in mid 2007, when process optimization initiatives and IT solutions development were still in progress, supported by a change management and communications program. Although several technical components and processes were planned to support managers and engineers on their daily operational activities, there wasn't any specific support tool for optimizing the collaborative environments utilization. That gap motivated the development of a customized solution, specifically designed to support some key processes, which run inside the asset's collaborative environments. The solution was named Collaborative Portal. This paper's objective is to describe the challenges faced by the asset's team and the lessons learned during the process of designing and effectively implementing the asset's Collaborative Environment and its customized support tool, the Collaborative Portal. This tool is successfully running since August 2008. It supports processes like the daily production monitoring meetings, gathering the asset manager and his key staff to efficiently and quickly monitor and control production status (KPIs), production losses, threats and opportunities, as well as defining, planning and following-up on preventive and corrective actions. It also supports other processes like anomalies prevention, customized meetings, visualization of offshore CCTV video cameras and manages the content of the asset's internal TV.

Despite the significant oil and gas industrial activities underway in the Campos Basin, scarce information is available regarding the hydrocarbon contents and microbial communities in the deep-sea sediments. To gain new insights on these aspects, we first obtained deep-sea sediment samples with different degrees of oil exposure. We obtained samples from a seabed fissure (N = 28), surroundings (250 m to 500 m from the fissure; N = 24), and a control area (N = 4). We used shotgun metagenomics to characterize the taxonomic and metabolic diversity and analyzed biogeochemical parameters (metal and oil concentration) of all samples. The high levels of unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons in the fissure indicate a potentially recent petrogenic contribution in these sediments. The fissure area was found to have a higher abundance of hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial genera and hydrocarbon degradation genes. These bacteria may be used as biosensors of sediment contamination. The effects of oil contamination, mainly around the fissure, are less clear at 250 m and 500 m, suggesting that the surroundings may not have been heavily affected by the oil leakage.

"85061498967","The ultimate effect that ocean acidification (OA) and warming will have on the physiology of calcifying algae is still largely uncertain. Responses depend on the complex interactions between seawater chemistry, global/local stressors and species-specific physiologies. There is a significant gap regarding the effect that metabolic interactions between coexisting species may have on local seawater chemistry and the concurrent effect of OA. Here, we manipulated CO2 and temperature to evaluate the physiological responses of two common photoautotrophs from shallow tropical marine coastal ecosystems in Brazil: the calcifying alga Halimeda cuneata, and the seagrass Halodule wrightii. We tested whether or not seagrass presence can influence the calcification rate of a widespread and abundant species of Halimeda under OA and warming. Our results demonstrate that under elevated CO2, the high photosynthetic rates of H. wrightii contribute to raise H. cuneata calcification more than two-fold and thus we suggest that H. cuneata populations coexisting with H. wrightii may have a higher resilience to OA conditions. This conclusion supports the more general hypothesis that, in coastal and shallow reef environments, the metabolic interactions between calcifying and non-calcifying organisms are instrumental in providing refuge against OA effects and increasing the resilience of the more OA-susceptible species. © 2019, The Author(s).","Seagrass can mitigate negative ocean acidification effects on calcifying algae","Nature Publishing Group",True,"2019"
"85072834829","The South Atlantic Aptian “Pre-Salt” shrubby carbonate successions offshore Brazil and Angola are of major interest due to their potential hydrocarbon accumulations. Although the general sedimentology of these deposits is widely recognized to be within saline, alkaline lakes in rift volcanic settings, the specific genesis of shrubby carbonate morphologies remains unclear. This study reports the first petrographically comparable shrubby carbonates amongst other carbonate microfacies from an Anthropocene limestone formed under hyperalkaline (pH 9–12) and hypersaline (conductivity 425–3200 μS) conditions at ambient temperature (12.5–13°C) (Consett, United Kingdom). This discovery allows us to capitalize on exceptional long-term hydrochemical monitoring efforts from the site, demonstrating that shrubby carbonates occur uniquely within the waters richest in calcium (∼240 mg/L) and with highest pH (∼12) and consequently with very high levels of supersaturation. However, the physical distribution of shrubs is more comparable with estimated local kinetic precipitation rate than it is to thermodynamic saturation, indicating that the fundamental control on shrub formation arises from crystal surface processes. The shrubby carbonate we report grows in the presence of significant diatomaceous and cyanobacterial biofilms, despite the highly alkaline conditions. These biofilms are lost from the deposited material early due to the high solubility of organic and silica within hyperalkaline settings, and this loss contributes to very high intercrystalline porosity. Despite the presence of these microbes, few if any of the fabrics we report would be considered as “boundstones” despite it being clear that most fabrics are being deposited in the presence of abundant extra-cellular polymeric substances. We are aware of no previous petrographic work on anthropogenic carbonates of this type, and recommend further investigation to capitalize on what can be learned from these “accidental laboratories.”. © Copyright © 2019 Bastianini, Rogerson, Mercedes-Martín, Prior, Cesar and Mayes.","What Causes Carbonates to Form “Shrubby” Morphologies?

"85101344072","The discovery and production, by Petrobras, of over 50 billion barrels in place of pre-salt oil in Brazil's offshore South Atlantic Santos and Campos basins has drawn worldwide attention to its km-thick Cretaceous salt seal since 2007. However, the depth of the pre-salt reservoir in these basins make prohibitive the costs of continuous coring or even extensive logging of the salt. The salt seal of the Santos and Campos basins forms part of the Cretaceous South Atlantic salt giant, the largest in the world, now divided between Brazil and southwestern Africa. Although our petrographic study is concentrated north of the Santos and Campos basins, we nevertheless discuss the age, facies, tectonic-paleogeographic controls and evolution of the entire Brazilian salt giant. Offshore Brazil, salt extends for 2.200 km from the Sergipe Basin in the northeast to the Santos Basin in the southwest. The Sergipe Basin at its NE end displays the full spectrum of evaporite cycles, spanning from carbonates, anhydrites and halites to the highly soluble hydrated Mg-chlorides carnallite, bischoffite and tachyhydrite, as does the Santos Basin in the SW part of the salt giant. The deposition of Mg-chlorides was terminated in Sergipe by an intra-salt unconformity at the carnallite/sylvinite contact, dated as 110.64 ± 0.34 Ma. In the intervening Espírito Santo and Campos basins, these highly soluble salts have not yet been found. Onshore Sergipe and Espírito Santo basins the entire salt sequence has been cored in several wells, including the highly soluble Mg–K–Ca chlorides. Here, we analyze the petrography and chemistry of cores in Sergipe and Espírito Santo. We prove the presence of tachyhydrite beds at both ends of the salt giant, in the Sergipe and Santos basins, but, at least for the time being, not in between the two basins. By comparing the presence of tachyhydrite beds in Brazil with similar evaporite sequences of similar age in Thailand, we defend that the high Ca/Mg and Ca/SO4 ratios in Cretaceous seawater was the de facto cause for tachyhydrite deposition in both regions. Ca/Mg and Ca/SO4 ratios of global seawater were raised by hydrothermal activity over basalts produced at exceptionally high rates in the Aptian along new mid-oceanic ridges and in oceanic plateaus such as Ontong-Java. The heat loss caused by this exceptionally high igneous activity may have been instrumental to the change of the thermochemical conditions across the core-mantle boundary that stabilized the Cretaceous Normal Superchron for nearly 40 Ma, from 123.4 to 121.2 Ma (2σ) to 83.07 ± 0.15 Ma (2σ) Ma. Aptian volcanic activity in the South Atlantic formed the Rio Grande Rise - Walvis Ridge that was the southern barrier of the salt basin, lava flows on the São Paulo Plateau, and basalts along the developing South Atlantic Ridge. Evaporite facies reflect cyclic changes on all scales when concentrating the depositing brines. We therefore analyze the effect of increases in brine concentration on the formation of salt crystals throughout multiple depositional cycles. In the later stages of the Brazilian salt basins, increased inflow of seawater from the Central Atlantic Ocean along the Equatorial pull-apart rift basins enlarged and deepened the existent brine lake while its salinity, and especially its Ca and Mg contents, dropped. Flooding by this less concentrated brine created an unconformity, leaching Mg and Ca from the carnallite and tachyhydrite previously deposited, and replacing them with secondary sylvinite. Our results can be applied to the essentially uncored salt sequence of the Campos and Santos basins, where igneous and hydrothermal activity provided additional sources of calcium. The Ca excess may have been increased still further by serpentinization of lithospheric mantle beneath hyperextended crust and by percolation of seawater through mafic rocks of the proto-Rio Grande Rise – Walvis Ridge that formed the southern barrier of the salt basin. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Petrography, geochemistry and origin of South Atlantic evaporites: The Brazilian side","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2021"

In Brazil, ocean buoy data are obtained by the Brazilian Navy through a monitoring network on the Brazilian coast, which has high potential for wind power generation. In this context, the present study aimed to analyze the scaling behavior of wind speed on the Brazilian coast (continental shelf), South Atlantic Ocean and coast of Africa in order to determine long-range correlations and acquire more information on the crossover phenomenon at various scales. For this purpose, the detrended fluctuation analysis technique and numerical simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model were used. The results from buoys show that wind speed exhibits a scaling behavior, but without the crossover phenomenon in the Brazilian coast, South Atlantic Ocean and coast of Africa, indicating the dependence of the phenomenon by the terrestrial surface, suggesting influence on the wind power generation. Buoy data from the South Atlantic Ocean and coast Africa showed a subdiffusive behavior (α≥1), whereas those from the Brazilian coast indicated persistence (0.5<α<1), except for the confluence region of Porto Seguro, which indicated anti-persistence (α=0.48). The numerical simulations using the WRF mesoscale model showed a subdiffusive behavior on the Brazilian coast, and no persistence was reproduced in most coastal buoys. The findings support deeper understanding of the wind regime and its associated properties, with particular attention to the Brazilian continental shelf, suggesting that the methodology is useful for assessing the potential of offshore wind power generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Scaling behavior of wind speed in the coast of Brazil and the South Atlantic Ocean: The crossover phenomenon","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2021"

The knowledge of modern pollen and spore morphology are very important to consistent palynomorph identifications and robust interpretations on past vegetation and climate change. The objective of this work was to describe pollen and spore palynomorph assemblage over Rio Grande do Sul inner continental shelf, to facilitate and improve palynomorph descriptions and interpretations. The Rio Grande do Sul coastal area is NE/SW oriented, extends for over 600 km, and has two inlets, Patos and Tramandaí lagoons. The water masses that influence this region are Subantarctic Shelf Water, Tropical Water and south Atlantic Central Water, beyond two freshwater sources, from Rio de la Plata estuary and Patos lagoon. The wind circulation there is strongly seasonal, predominantly NE during summer and SW during winter. The surface sediments were sampled in two sites: (i) 48 samples from Balneário Hermenegildo (REMPLAC Project) and (ii) 5 samples from ‘Amazônia Azul’ Project, at Patos lagoon inlet area. We have identified the following families: one family of Bryophyta: Anthocerothaceae; eight families of Pteridophyta: Blechnaceae, Cyatheaceae, Equisetaceae, Lycopodiaceae, Ophioglossaceae, Osmundaceae, Pteridaceae and Polypodiaceae; three families of Monocotyledons: Arecaceae, Cyperaceae and Poaceae; and seven families of Eudicotyledons: Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Betulaceae, Fabaceae, Melastomataceae, Typhaceae and Verbenaceae.

"85085773523","This article presents a set of analysis and results on Shared-Actuation Control (SAC) techniques, intended for the remote control of valves in subsea manifolds. The discussion covers historical aspects, including presentation of real cases of SAC in Brazilian fields of Petrobras, as well as covers a conceptualization for the technique. The formulated concepts are used indeed to derive a methodology, intended to guide the development of SAC schemes, during engineering projects of subsea manifolds. The discussion is based in part on the unique experience accumulated by Petrobras in the last 20 years, with the development and introduction of a SAC-based subsea manifold in Campos Basin, Brazil, and the latest development efforts ongoing by 2019 for a new generation of SAC, for the application in subsea manifolds to be installed in ultra-deep waters of Pre-Salt fields, in Santos Basin, Brazil. The methodology proposed in this article is based on a comparative approach which aims to incorporate, on design of SAC, the best engineering practices and lessons learned from traditional Electric-Hydraulic Multiplexed Control Systems (EHMCSs). We refer to such approach as the Inheritance & Counterbalance (I&C) Methodology, since it is based on the application of two specific principles, namely, the Inheritance and Counterbalance Principles. The principles are proposed in this article as well. Taking as starting point a set of technical characteristics of EHMCSs, such as employment of redundant subsea electronics and methods of subsea installation, a subsea engineer can apply the I&C Principles to determine if SAC should inherit a given EHMCS characteristic or, if inheritance is not feasible for some reason, adopt alternative requisites on SAC, in order to counterbalance the effects of such no inheritance. The conceptualization of the I&C Methodology allow us effectively applying it, to obtain as result a table of engineering requisites, suitable for SAC schemes destined to subsea manifolds. The proposed table is presented in this article and incorporates several engineering aspects, which are arbitrated from the knowledge on previous applications of Petrobras in subsea control systems. Such applications include both SAC schemes and EHMCSs, featured on fields of Campos and Santos Basins. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","On the shared-actuation control for the operation of manifolds in subsea production systems","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"84893805098","The logistics of research on deep-sea organisms imposes restrictions on studies that require repetitive long-term collections. Studies on the reproduction of deep-water corals have commonly been made without appropriate temporal series. This study included Madrepora oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis, Lophelia pertusa, and Enallopsammia rostrata, which are among the primary deep-sea reef building corals off Brazil. Samples were collected during 13 consecutive months by the Campos Basin Deep-Sea Corals Assessment Project (R&D Center of the Brazilian Energy Company, Petrobras) in Campos Basin (CB) off Rio de Janeiro State through a remotely-operated-vehicle at approximately 600. m depth. Of every monthly sampling campaign, an average of four to five colonies of all four species were investigated histologically. Colonies of both sexes were observed, indicating that all four species are gonochoric. For now, this appears to be the predominant reproductive pattern observed in corals in the area, as well as in deep-sea corals in general, where 80% of coral species are gonochoric. Although considered functionally gonochoric, M. oculata and L. pertusa presented a few colonies with different hermaphroditism patterns. E. rostrata and M. oculata presented continuous reproduction. Although fertile year-round, S. variabilis presents a reproductive peak between April and September (Autumn-Spring) in contrast with the seasonal reproduction recorded in the southwestern Pacific. L. pertusa had a seasonal reproductive peak, confirming previous observations of periodic reproduction in this species in the northeastern Atlantic. The possible spawning season of L. pertusa from CB concentrates between May and July (high frequency of mature gametes), while spawning occurs between January and March in the North Atlantic and between September and November in the Gulf of Mexico. Our results suggest that the studied species are broadcast spawners because no embryos or larvae were observed in any examined sample.

"85009177497","Bathymetry surveys are the first step for every conservation effort on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Maps depicting depth and bottom geomorphology are used to generate hillshades, that later become basemaps for other themes, such as fish distribution, bottom types, and water quality. Bathymetry map availability is limited or non-existent at the scales that are necessary for MPA management plans. Survey costs by traditional sounding methods or new technologies, such as LIDAR, are prohibitive for most MPA budgets. Remote Sensing bathymetry is yet unreliable, except for crystal clear waters. A low-cost technique, based on commercially available GPS-echosounder units was applied to obtain detailed bathymetry of two MPAs in coastal Brazil: at the Parque Municipal Marinho da Coroa Alta (PMMCA), located in the coastal reefs of Santa Cruz de Cabralia, State of Bahia, and Monumento Natural das Ilhas Cagarras (MNIC), off Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro. Equipment consisted of a Simrad NSS-7 chartplotter mounted permanently on Iamany, a 7 m-long, fiberglass-hull, twin-engine boat for PMMCA, and a Garmin GPSMap 521 chartplotter mounted on Caçaõ, an inflatable, 6 m-long, single-engine boat hired for MNIC. Survey frequencies for the echosounders were set at 50 kHz. Cross-shelf, East-West lines spaced 100m apart with readings every second (1-3 m, depending on boat speed) were obtained for PMMCA over 30 days of 4-6 hours of navigation around the highest tide (ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 m above mean sea-level). At MNIC, radial lines surrounding each of the islands were placed 50 m apart at their outer limits, and readings were obtained every 10 seconds (∼10 m) in 7 days of 3-4 hours of navigation around the highest tides (ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 m above mean sea-level). In the shallow coral reefs of Bahia, 62 km2 were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 20m, while at the sandy bottom around the granite-gneiss islands of Rio de Janeiro, 6 km2 were surveyed, with depths varying from 0 to 40m. Data in the echosounders proprietary format, were saved on Micro-SD or SD memory cards, converted to XYZ format (.csv) and migrated to GIS, where a linear tide correction was applied. Interpolation methods such as Radial Basis Functions and ANUDEM generated maps with 10 m pixels for PMMCA (presented at 1:10.000 and 1:25.000) and 5 m pixels for MNIC (presented at 1:3.000 and 1:10.000). Average survey costs are estimated at R$ 500-650/day or R$ 1.000/km2 (∼US$ 250/day or ∼US$ 400/km2), depending on boat ownership vs. rental cost. This represents less than 1/10 of the official traditional survey costs, and even less when compared to LIDAR bathymetry. Precision obtained is an order of magnitude higher than previously available, and enough for environmental assessment for conservation management of the MPAs involved.

"85078233209","The mechanism by which seaward dipping reflectors (SDRs) are formed is a topic of debate. Two contrasting models exist for their formation, the volcanic-faulting model and the volcanic-loading model. Each of these models has important implications for the processes which control the structure and formation of magma-rich rifted continental margins. We have examined high-quality deep-seismic reflection data across the Pelotas Basin, offshore Brazil. These data reveal a remarkable set of SDRs, for which we have investigated the likely nature of their formation. The total package of SDRs has an across-strike width of ~200 km and a variable vertical thickness of ~10–17 km, previously interpreted as volcanic flows. Detailed observations, however, show changes in seismic character and geometry within the SDR package, which suggest a complex and varied evolution. We have used gravity anomaly inversion and seismic observations together to investigate the likely composition of the SDRs by determining the proportion of basaltic material to sedimentary/volcaniclastic material (basalt fraction) within the SDRs. This has been achieved by minimising the difference between the depth of the gravity Moho and seismic Moho in order to quantify the lateral variation in basalt fraction, taken to be proportional to the bulk density of the package. The density of the SDR package together with seismic interpretation is then used to infer the composition, depositional environment, source and time of formation relative to breakup. Our analysis suggests that the overall SDR basalt fraction and bulk density decrease oceanwards, possibly due a change in the type of volcanic deposits from predominantly subaerial to volcaniclastics, possibly deposited subaqueously. The SDRs can be split into three sub-packages. The two inner SDR packages are interpreted to consist of lava flows sourced from syn-tectonic, subaerial eruptions, associated with the onshore Paraná Large Igneous Province, flowing eastwards into an extensional basin. The outer SDR package shows reflector geometries that progressively offlap oceanwards, interpreted as extrusives sourced from an eastwards-migrating, newly formed ocean ridge. Our analysis suggests that both the volcanic-faulting and volcanic-loading models for SDR formation are applicable to the Pelotas rifted margin, recording distinct syn-rift and syn-breakup magmatic events. We show that both SDR formation models can be recognised in a naturally occurring example and can coexist on the same margin. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Origin, composition and relative timing of seaward dipping reflectors on the Pelotas rifted margin","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2020"

Nineteen samples were processed following the standard methodology for palynological studies. Organic matter (OM) content was measured in the sediments. The age model was established according to 18O isotopes analyses in benthic foraminiferal tests. The studied interval corresponds to a glacial interval, divided in palynozones (PZs): PZIa (66.5-64.5 kyr), PZIb (64.5-53.5 kyr), and PZII (53.5-47 kyr). PZIa was characterized by drier conditions, with grassland and salt marsh taxa dominance (Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae). During PZIb and PZII, the increase of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Araucaria angustifolia, Arecaceae, and Alchornea triplinervia points to wetter and warmer conditions that may be related to the beginning of marine isotope stage 3 and later to the sea-level rise. In the oceanic environment, the presence of freshwater algae and marine indicators lead to the conclusion that marine conditions prevailed during Rio Grande Cone sedimentary formation, even under low sea-level conditions when terrigenous influence was stronger. The data on OM content, dinoflagellate taxa, and mean sea level changes point to a period of low productivity during PZI. In PZII, a period of higher productivity took place because of Subantarctic Shelf Water influence, bringing cold and nutrient-rich waters to the area. ©","Paleoenvironmental Reconstruction off Southern Brazil during a Glacial Period (66.5-47 kyr BP): Continental and Oceanic Environments","Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc.",True,"2020"

The forms and occasions in which these changes can be detected on 4D seismic are studied, to help in the characterization of the fluid flow inside the reservoir. To analyze these effects, reservoir production simulations were conducted in a geological model of a sandstone reservoir in the Campos Basin, offshore SE Brazil. Through direct petro-elastic and seismic modeling, 4D impedance volumes were created using simulation results, and corresponding synthetic seismic volumes were computed. Simulations of both water injection and gas injection scenarios were conducted in order to quantify the differences between oil-water and oil-gas substitutions and investigate how they affect the seismic amplitudes in a sandstone reservoir. The interpretations allow the definition of patterns to identify pressure and saturation related anomalies and to distinguish areas of water and gas injection. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Mapping of water and gas injection areas through modeling and interpretation of 4D seismic from reservoir simulation models","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2017"
"84979574362","This study aimed to assess spatial and temporal ecosystem health variability of coral reefs in the Tamandaré open embayment, located in Northeast Brazil, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, using water and sediment parameters and benthic foraminifera as bioindicators. Sediment samples were collected during the summer and winter of 2005 at the reef base, generally built over beachrock structures. The FORAM index (FI, a foraminiferal functional group, community-based water quality assessment), and the FORAM Stress Index (FSI, which is more related to ecological affinities than to functional groups and assesses sediment or substrata quality) together with geochemical data were interpreted using uni- and multi-variate analysis. This is the first application of FSI outside of Mediterranean waters. The dominance of the Quinqueloculina and Textularia, along with negligible numbers of living specimens, low counts of symbiont-bearing foraminifera (and thus low FI), high turbidity and high phosphorus concentrations confirm the anthropogenic influence of river inputs. All parameters suggest that the water and sediment of the Tamandaré embayment are marginal for coral population settlement, although the FSI, which presents higher values at unpolluted ecosystems, suggests more sustainable conditions during summer than winter, as found for FI. The FI indication of marginal environmental health is not in agreement with the FSI and the currently stable coral population found over the underlying beachrock, especially at the established no-take zone where good conditions have been described. The central transect, influenced by the no-take zone, presents the most favorable sedimentary sector for conservation initiatives, as indicated by foraminifera and other variables, preferentially on the summer season due to low river discharge of sediments.

"85027233889","Geologic events related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean deeply influenced the sedimentary record of the Araripe Basin. As consequence, upper stratigraphic units of the basin record a marine ingression in northeastern Brazil during the late Aptian. The timing and stratigraphic architecture of these units are crucial to understand the paleogeography of Gondwana and how the proto-Atlantic Ocean reached interior NE Brazil during the early Cretaceous. This marine ingression is recorded in the Araripe Basin as the Romualdo Formation, characterized by a transgressive-regressive cycle bounded by two regional unconformities. In the eastern part of the basin, the Romualdo depositional sequence comprises coastal alluvial and tide-dominated deposits followed by marine transgressive facies characterized by two fossil-rich intervals: a lower interval of black shales with fossil-rich carbonate concretions (Konservat-Lagerstätten) and an upper level with mollusk-dominated shell beds and shelly limestones. Following the marine ingression, an incomplete regressive succession of marginal-marine facies records the return of continental environments to the basin. The stratigraphic framework based on the correlation of several sections defines a transgressive-regressive cycle with depositional dip towards southeast, decreasing in thickness towards northwest, and with source areas located at the northern side of the basin. The facies-cycle wedge-geometry, together with paleocurrent data, indicates a coastal onlap towards NNW. Therefore, contrary to several paleogeographic scenarios previously proposed, the marine ingression would have reached the western parts of the Araripe Basin from the SSE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","The transgressive-regressive cycle of the Romualdo Formation (Araripe Basin): Sedimentary archive of the Early Cretaceous marine ingression in the interior of Northeast Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2017"

CO2/miscible gas injection and Water Alternating Gas injection (WAG) are the most attractive EOR methods being considered by most offshore operators. Due to limitations imposed by the surface facility, any process optimization done through standalone reservoir simulation could be unreliable as the facility constraints and its effects are neglected. In order to minimize risk and reduce uncertainty, successful modelling and optimization of such projects requires integration of subsurface modelling with surface facility model. In this work, field development and optimization of a complex offshore production system, from a Pre-Salt carbonate reservoir offshore of Brazil is studied. Different field development scenarios, including water flooding, miscible gas injection, and WAG injection, are considered. Compositional fluid model is used in order to correctly model the fluid mixing effects and miscibility. Pressure change and thermal effects are considered in all the facility equipment. The complexities of the surface network, including gas sweetening, compression, and fluid blending are included in the integrated model. A new multi-user, multi-disciplinary Integrated Production System Modelling (IPSM) tool is used to fully-implicitly couple reservoir simulation with surface facility model. Production from the offshore asset is optimized for different development scenarios. The provided IPSM approach optimized operational schemes that were consistent with the constraints of the offshore facility. Additionally, with this new approach, all users from different disciplines were able to collaborate seamlessly, and any possible inconsistencies and discontinuities that could occur due to use of multiple decision making tools were removed. The use of integrated production systems modelling for optimizing EOR schemes in offshore assets, particularly miscible WAG, is proved to provide more robust answers.

The results obtained from inspection and numerical reanalysis furnishes important feedback for the integrity management of the two pipelines, reducing potential risks and lessons learned for future projects. Deepwater pipelines submitted to high pressures and temperatures (HP/HT) are susceptible to global buckling due to axial compressive load. To guarantee pipeline and equipment’s integrity frequently is necessary to relieve high stresses and strains at buckle apex as well as to mitigate end expansion. Thus, the two parallel HP/HT pipelines were designed with single and double sleepers to trigger buckles at pre-determined locations and an anchoring system to prevent pipeline walking. Another important design aspect was to avoid undesirable buckles at the several crossings along the pipeline route applying a special device with stoppers to lock lateral displacements. During a programmed inspection as part of regular Petrobras pipeline integrity program of rigid pipelines (PIDR), it has been verified that some double sleepers didn’t work as foreseen in design. Otherwise, some unplanned buckles on soil have been formed along the two pipelines changing the buckle apex stress levels and end expansions foreseen in detailed design. In order to understand buckle formation behavior and guarantee long-term integrity of the HP/HT pipelines a Multi-Beam Echosounder Survey (MBES) was conducted in 2016 to build a representative Finite Element (FE) model. The temperature and pressure gradients from steady state and transient conditions were obtained from flow assurance simulations based on monitored platform operational historic data. The FE model was calibrated with buckle shapes and end displacements to assess pipeline behavior and its long-term integrity for load scenarios different from original design.

"85065912337","Most subsurface rock models consider salt bodies as homogenous masses and set to evaporite minerals constant values of elastic properties such as density, compressional and shear velocities, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. Lithological analyzes of outcrops and wells indicate that evaporites present large vertical and lateral heterogeneities. Recent studies have demonstrated that the knowledge of the elastic properties of rock salt can substantially benefit velocity modeling, seismic imaging, reservoir geomechanical analysis, prediction of wellbore stability and calculation of optimum fluid weight. However, few papers document the spatial estimation of elastic properties for salt formations. We propose an approach to characterize the internal structures of the salt bodies in the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil, using well and 3D seismic data. It starts with a rock-physics analysis at well-log scale, which reveals that the elastic properties of rock salt are highly correlated. Once the relationships of the elastic properties are established, we explore the functionality of the empirical equations as property predictors. We demonstrate that the elastic properties can be empirically estimated from compressional velocity. The comparison between the estimated and the measured well logs validates the estimation. Then, we perform the seismic inversion to generate the spatial distribution of the acoustic impedance. We derive compressional and shear velocities, density, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio volumes by applying the empirical equations to the acoustic impedance volume. The blind well points out that, through this workflow, the seismic data can successfully predict the elastic properties of the salt formation in undrilled portions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elastic properties of rock salt in the Santos Basin: Relations and spatial predictions","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"

The main focus of this study is the analysis of the risers influence on the floating unit dynamics, taking into account damping effects caused by the lines. In order to establish basis of comparison the tests were performed with and without risers. These were modeled as a group of large diameter hoses that are able to provide a significant increment in the damping of the system. By such approach, it was possible to evaluate the changes on the dynamic behavior of the unit induced by the presence of risers.

"85088763109","Source rocks from the Santos basin pre-salt in Brazil, namely the Itapema and Piçarras formations, are characterized based on their total organic carbon content (TOC) with the aid of an acoustic inversion and TOC data from wells. The inverted P-impedance volume is converted into a %TOC volume by applying a formula (empirically derived from well data) that relates P-impedance to TOC. The derived %TOC volume is corrected for compaction in order to compensate for the effect burial has on the P-impedance volume. This %TOC volume aids in the mapping of the source rocks and their extent. It is found that source rocks from within the deeper rift section (where no well data is available) are thicker and that their %TOC increases with depth. A rise in %TOC is indicative of more primary production or better preservation potential (more anoxic conditions) at the time of deposition. Deposition rates for the source rock and subsidence must have been higher in the depocenter of the lower syn-rift in order to account for the thicker source rock deposits. © 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019.

The paper discusses the performance of the ESP system utilizing field data and software simulations. The in-well ESP is the main production method and mudline ESP boosting is the backup one. Both concepts proved to be effective artificial lift solutions for the harsh flowing conditions. The in-well ESP is installed inside a capsule in a close to horizontal slant section of around 70 m. The mudline ESP boosting is readily available to become the main production method in case the in-well ESP fails. This paper discusses the challenges and solutions that proved to be successful after more than 18 months of continuous production. Software simulations and continuous production monitoring were key factors for system modeling and optimization. One of the most powerful ESPs installed inside a well worldwide to produce heavy and viscous oil from an unconsolidated reservoir represents a step forward in ultra-deepwater production system boundaries. The concept of having the mudline system as backup is also an innovative step for the offshore oil and gas industry. Two production periods are presented with very distinct and unusual characteristics: (i) one producing 12,500 bpd of a high viscous, high Gas Void Fraction (GVF), low inlet pressure and temperature crude through two mudline ESP boosting systems and (ii) another one producing 30,000 bpd through three inwell ESPs. © Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Artificial Lift Conference and Exhibition - Americas 2020, ALCE 2020.

"85062013573","With the expansion of oil exploration in deep waters, assessing the risks associated with offloading operations becomes essential in preventing accidents that may cause huge environmental disasters. In this paper, the system that composed of a turret-moored floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) connected to a conventional shuttle tanker, which is assisted by a tug boat to maintain its position during an offloading operation, will be studied. Using environmental data collected over a period of 6 years, from 2004 to 2009, from the Campos Basin in Brazil, the equilibrium positions of the system were calculated, considering its constraints (operational criteria defined by Petrobras) and verifying the stability of those equilibrium points. The hydrodynamic and aerodynamic static forces were calculated using models validated in the literature. Dynamic effects and oscillations are taken into account by adding safety margins to the operational sectors. With this analysis, we calculated the FPSO heading probabilities during an offloading operation and the expected downtime of operation in Campos Basin. We concluded that the downtime of the offloading operation with a conventional shuttle tanker is close to that with a dynamic positioned (DP) shuttle tanker (10% downtime). Furthermore, the results from the stability analysis were used to generate a simplified set of rules to classify the environmental conditions into four classes of operational risk by applying an unbiased decision tree. This method obtains practical rules based on measurements of wind, wave, and current, allowing the operator to quickly evaluate the risk level before starting the operation. Copyright © 2019 by ASME.

The P55 field is located offshore Brazil, in the northern area of Campos Basin, in a water depth ranging from 1500m to 1900m. The scope of work consisted in engineering, procuring, fabricating and installing 16 rigid Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs), which are the first of their kind in this area. The corresponding 12-inch SCR qualification results are presented in the perspective to show the significant benefits of the technology used and its potential developments to High Pressure & High Temperature applications. In order to meet tight Hi-Lo requirements together with high fatigue performances, innovative Pipe End Design and associated automatic welding procedures were developed and qualified. The paper describes the complete sequence of pipe manufacturing process, from hot-rolling to final machining, which resulted in a concentric and reproducible pipe end geometry, ideal for limiting Stress Concentration Factors. An extensive qualification program of Full Scale Fatigue test was conducted on girth-welded strings and the associated results showed performance levels at least four times above the target curve. Moreover, Lessons Learned from the offshore campaign established that developed Pipe End Design led to significant improvements in welding times and subsequent J-laying rates. Details on how the technology effectively reduces critical times and lowers rejection rates are provided on the basis of the actual P55 offshore campaign. In addition to the advantages detailed in the paper, the presented linepipe solution proves to be also applicable to High Temperature fields, since the enhanced fatigue behavior was found to compensate a temperature derating up to 270°C. In fact, the presented manufacturing and welding technologies have opened the perspective of ongoing Developments, which are believed to bring a reliable solution for combined High Pressure and High Temperature applications.

The Atlanta field project was planned to be developed in two phases: the Early Production System (EPS) with three production wells, and the Definitive Production System (DPS) with up to nine wells. No injection wells have been planned. In 2013 and 2014 the first two wells, here called ATL-2 and ATL-3 (ATL-1 was a pilot well), were successfully drilled, completed, and tested as described in the above references. In May 2018, they started production. After almost one year and 5,000,000 bbl of produced oil, the third EPS well was constructed. The lessons learned in each phase of the well construction - drilling, lower completion, and upper completion - were applied in the third well, repeating the good operational performance. An analysis of this comparative performance is presented. Technology improvements were implemented, such as the use of autonomous inflow control devices (AICD), the use of micro-tortuosity logging to better position the electrical submersible pump (ESP), the use of an annulus diverter valve (ADV) to avoid the pressure drop across the ESP in case of failure, etc. The result was a well constructed ahead the planned time with a Productivity Index (PI) that exceeded expectations. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Atlanta Field: Constructing long horizontal wells in a challenging environment","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"

The development of offshore anchoring systems with Torpedo Pile is a technological application that can save time and cost during the mooring installation. With a very efficient holding capacity, and using the free-fall energy for its own installation, this technology is widely used in Brazil, by Petrobras. It is estimated that more than 2,000 torpedo piles were successfully installed in Brazil's shore. This Kind of Anchor is field proven, applied to FPSOs, Rigs, Steel Risers, Flexible flowlines and Umbilical cables anchor process, with a large range of holding capacity loads. This paper presents the advantages to use this technology, considering the overall mooring installation process, and suggest different applications for torpedo piles. Considering the nowadays increasing requirement for renewable energy, and the large potential for offshore wind power generation, this work brings the proposal to use the torpedo pile technology in the mooring design for the floating wind turbines.

"85090646059","Old photos showing rocks with barnacles and oysters lines were compared with recent photos in 18 areas of 5 Brazilian states (Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, and Santa Catarina). They suggest that the sea level in the region has been stable since 1864, at least. In 2017, 2018, and 2019, photos of the same rocks were taken, considering the original distance and angle, to compare to the old ones, made between the years 1864 and 1950. The calculations were made comparing the lethal line (LL) produced by the crustacean Balanus and the mollusks Crassostrea brasiliana and Crassostrea rhizophorae. The results show identical situation in 13 research areas, from 18 in total. In 5 areas it was not possible to compare due to the lower quality data. If the sea level is going up, the upper lines created by the barnacles and oysters should be higher in the 18 areas, because those creatures respond fast, they can repopulate the rock surface in four months, only. Nevertheless, visible changes in the lethal lines were not seen during the last 165 years. The conclusion suggests two possibilities: the first one is that the sea is at a level similar to the one in 1864, it made no change; the second one is that the regional crust is lifting up quick in the same rate of a supposed sea level change. However, it goes against the geological models because the region is situated on a stable tectonic area. © 2020, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

However, the expectation of a large increase in demand for energy in the coming decades is attracting new investments by oil companies. Although a matter that dominates the scene in Brazil, E&P in deep waters has marginal international participation and encounters unexplored frontiers. The global oil industry has discovered about 60,000 million bbl of petroleum in deep waters, half of which since 1995 has occurred in Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Africa, according to one study. In a study by the Total company, 90% of the global reserves of petroleum in deep waters of about 50,000 million bbl, are to be found in the ""Golden Triangle"" of the petroleum industry, namely, Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Africa. There is a consensus that the high prices for petroleum are an indication that exploration for petroleum in deep waters off Latin America may significantly increase the reserves of the region. The world consumes about 75,000 million bpd of crude oil and 6.5 MMM cu m/day of natural gas. Hardly some 3 MM bpd of crude oil are produced in deep waters or 4% of the total volume explored. In the coming three decades the demand for energy is expected to increase by two thirds and between now and 2015 the production in deep waters could triple reaching over 8 MM bpd.

A consortium led by Enterprise Oil and its partners, Odebrecht and Petrobras, is developing the fields. The two fields will be developed as subsea tiebacks to an FPSO with offset distances ranging from 2 to 3 km. The system comprises subsea manifolds, flowlines and risers with capability for round trip pigging. The paper will provide a brief overview of the main flow assurance challenges. Two of the flow assurance challenges highlighted include hydrates management and liquid slugging. During various production operations, produced fluids can potentially be cooled by the surrounding cold water, resulting in gas hydrates. Such blockages can plug the bore of the subsea tree, tree piping, well jumper, manifolds, flowlines and risers, causing loss of production and inability to open or close subsea valves. The hydrate management philosophy for this project considered the following: Use a combination of chemical injection using either ethanol or methanol and thermal insulation. Thermal insulation on subsea production system to provide sufficient cool down time without operator action. For long-term unplanned shut down, flowlines and risers can be depressurized and displaced. Circulate ""dry"" hot oil in the flowlines and risers prior to re-start. Hydrate inhibitor injection into the subsea system during start up and shut down. Liquid slug behavior is another important consideration in the design of the production system. Large liquid slugs arriving at the FPSO can cause several problems, such as exceeding the capacity of the topsides separators, impact loads on topsides piping and swivels, vibration of risers, and erratic well flow behavior. Severe slugging is likely in the Salema flowlines due to the combination of downhill profile from the manifold towards the riser base and the potentially low flow rates expected. This paper will present an overview of the selection and design process adopted to manage hydrates and liquid slugging for this field development considering system thermal and hydraulic performance, cost and ease of field installation and production operations.","Flow Assurance Management for Bijupira and Salema Field Development","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2002"
"85053770238","Diapir piercement through the ocean floor marks the final stages of a dynamic migration path. Once exhumed, a diapir extrudes from the seafloor, placing an obstacle for the flow of ocean bottom currents. While the hydrodynamic response of the flow has been previously studied, the detailed depositional and weathering modifications involved in the piercement process are less understood. To bridge this gap, we gathered already available multibeam bathymetric data, multichannel 2D seismic reflection profiles and collected new single-channel CHIRP profiles, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data and sediment samples across Santos Basin, offshore Brazil. In this region, the processes connecting the uppermost subsurface with the lowermost section of the water column are unknown. Data show three main stages of diapir exhumation: pre-, syn- and post-piercement into the seafloor. Extensional faults crown the pre-exposed diapir, before its piercement through the seafloor. Ocean bottom currents rework the top of the faults to form elongated depressions. The bottom currents tightly detour the diapir during and after its exposure at the seafloor. This interaction forms a drift and moat contourite depositional pattern. Our high-resolution data allow relating these morphologies to seafloor processes and distinguishing them from other reflector geometries related to diapir flank deformation, such as outward dipping of reflections. We further use this geometrical distinction to suggest a key for interpreting the exposure versus burial history of other diapirs worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","A detailed look at diapir piercement onto the ocean floor: New evidence from Santos Basin, offshore Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2018"
"85073705401","While environmental drivers regulate the structure of mangrove microbial communities, their exact nature and the extent of their influence require further elucidation. By means of 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing, we determined the microbial taxonomic profiles of mangroves in the subtropical Paranaguá Bay, Brazil, considering as potential drivers: salinity, as represented by two sectors in the extremes of a salinity gradient (<5 PSU and >30 PSU); proximity to/absence of the prevailing plants, Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa, Rhizophora mangle, and Spartina alterniflora; and the chemical composition of the sediments. Salinity levels within the estuary had the strongest influence on microbial structure, and pH was important to separate two communities within the high salinity environment. About one fourth of the total variation in community structure resulted from covariation of salinity and the overall chemical composition, which might indicate that the chemical profile was also related to salinity. The most prevalent bacterial phyla associated with the mangrove soils analyzed included Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. Taxonomic and functional comparisons of our results for whole-genome sequencing with available data from other biomes showed that the studied microbiomes cluster first according to biome type, then to matrix type and salinity status. Metabolic functions were more conserved than organisms within mangroves and across all biomes, indicating that core functions are preserved in any of the given conditions regardless of the specific organisms harboring them. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Metataxonomic and metagenomic analysis of mangrove microbiomes reveals community patterns driven by salinity and pH gradients in Paranaguá Bay, Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"

In this context, entrepreneurs (operators, constructors, shipowners and shipyards) as well as governmental funding entities, financial agents and insurance companies, face new challenges, commensurate with the size and complexity of the involved projects, and their degree of innovation. In addition to the specific challenges of a more technical nature, special care should be given to those involving critical business decisions, such as the development and analysis of feasibility studies, validation of assumptions, risk analyses, insurance warranties, contract evaluation, claims and contractual amendments, construction follow-up, and physical and financial progress of projects in the marine and offshore markets. This paper presents and discusses some important technical and economic aspects involved in these studies and typical difficulties found in projects of greater complexity, comparing and evaluating different approaches and mechanisms, and their suitability to the needs and resources of key stakeholders. The authors intend to contribute to the identification, discussion and dissemination of available best practices, comparing them with those applied in similar contexts, both in the domestic and international scenarios. The paper also presents suggestions for the improvement and development of methodologies and tools, addressing issues of the content and format of reports and studies, as well as the support of information systems.

"85085778895","This paper provides an overview of the main efforts that are being endeavored by Petrobras in order to contribute for developing a Brazilian regulation for use and discharge of drilling fluids and cuttings from offshore oil and gas operation, based on operational safety, well integrity and environmental aspects. In early 2018, the Brazilian Environmental Agency launched a Normative Instruction (IN 01/2018) addressing some new conditions for use and discharge of fluids and cuttings from offshore drilling rigs. This regulation is based on the EPA rules, although some relevant points deviate from it, such as the prohibition for discharging drilling fluids and cuttings associated with hydrocarbon reservoir sections. Additionally, this regulation mentions a potential zero discharge by 2022. Due to the challenges for meeting these new requirements and some uncertainty about the real environmental benefits, Petrobras has been developing fundamental and applied studies, research development and protocols in this area. Petrobras settled an innovative governance model to deal with the new regulation, its consequences and interfaces. It works as a multidisciplinary committee coordinated by an executive manager. It involves a law support for environmental issues and four work fronts, such as (1) linking between internal and external organization (2) guarantee of providing the required infrastructure (3) economical and operational impacts (4) technologies (research, development, studies and protocols) dedicated for related matters. Concerning the forth front, seven important initiatives were initially addressed and cover topics such as operational safety, well integrity - including offshore wells dedicated to cuttings disposal, laboratory protocols and environmental issues. Some relevant studies are those concerning LCA (life cycle analysis), options for avoiding landfill as final cutting disposal onshore and the quantification of oil compounds in drilling fluids and cuttings from the pay zone well section. The lack of knowledge about the whole impact for onshore destination as drilling waste management strategy, the improvements that still have to be established in order to achieve better operational practices and the comprehension of the input of oil from drilling discharges are the main drivers of this paper. The results help to clarify cloudy topics and, consequently, contribute to create a new basis for building or revisiting some aspects of the present regulation. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Corporate strategy to tackle offshore drilling discharge regulation","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"85073935907","The stability of methane hydrates on continental margins worldwide is sensitive to changes in temperature and pressure conditions. It has been shown how gradual increases in bottom water temperatures due to ocean warming over post-glacial timescales can destabilize shallow oceanic hydrate deposits, causing their dissociation and gas release into the ocean. However, bottom water temperatures (BWT) may also vary significantly over much shorter timescales, including due to seasonal temperature oscillations of the ocean bottom currents. In this study, we investigate how a shallow methane hydrate deposit responds to seasonal BWT oscillations with an amplitude of up to 1.5 °C. We use the TOUGH + HYDRATE code to model changes in the methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) using data from the Rio Grande Cone, in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Brazilian coast. In all the cases studied, BWT oscillations resulted in significant gaseous methane fluxes into the ocean for up to 10 years, followed by a short period of small fluxes of gaseous methane into the ocean, until they stopped completely. On the other hand, aqueous methane was released into the ocean during the 100 years simulated, for all the cases studied. During the temperature oscillations, the MHSZ recedes continuously both horizontally and, in a smaller scale, vertically, until a permanent and a seasonal region in MHSZ are defined. Sensitivity tests were carried out for parameters of porosity, thermal conductivity and initial hydrate saturation, which were shown to play an important role on the volume of methane released into the ocean and on the time interval in which such release occurs. Overall, the results indicate that in a system with no gas recharge from the bottom, seasonal temperature oscillations alone cannot account for long-term gas release into the ocean. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Modelling methane hydrate stability changes and gas release due to seasonal oscillations in bottom water temperatures on the Rio Grande cone, offshore southern Brazil","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2020"
"85088793210","Conservation science is a mission-driven discipline, yet there are few assessments on whether conservation practices follow scientific recommendations, and thus missed opportunities for improvement. Brazil has among the greatest gaps in species protection by Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) globally and is thus a priority for future marine conservation efforts. In this paper, we assess the federal marine protected area (MPA) planning process in Brazil and compare it to a systematic conservation planning approach, focused on achieving conservation benefits while minimizing associated costs. We review the available information for all (70) federal MPAs, and the 26 associated management plans available. We found five simple opportunities for improving national MPA planning: (1) identifying specific and quantitative objectives and linking them to timeframes and budgets; (2) developing strategic monitoring and evaluation programs focused on MPA performance; (3) enabling local stakeholders to participate in planning processes, (4) explicitly considering MPA costs and leveraging existing sources of funding, and (5) decentralizing resource management and empowering local stakeholders to manage resources sustainably. Many reviewed MPA planning efforts fall short in providing clear management guidance and our recommendations can foster a stronger platform for the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources in Brazil. © 2020","Opportunities to close the gap between science and practice for Marine Protected Areas in Brazil","Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao",True,"2020"

"84943338721","This article discusses the development of several mega projects for the development of the Pre-Salt fields, in the Santos Basin, deepwater, offshore Brazil. Special focus is given to the Lula Field, a super giant field, operated by Petrobras, having BG Brasil and Petrogal Brasil as partners. Discovered in 2006 and with an estimated potential recoverable volume up to 8.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), Lula field placed pre-salt fields in the spotlight as it opened a new prospective frontier in Brazilian deep waters. To develop Lula field, a multi-module development project, it was adopted a fast track strategy to achieve material production levels in a very short time frame. In such a massive capital expenditure program, in an area with no infrastructure, and in an environment of heterogeneous carbonate reservoir, risk mitigation actions are a must. The first step taken was to acquire static and dynamic reservoir data, through data acquisition wells, extended well tests and implementation of two pilot FPSOs. Also, flexibility in the projects was carefully evaluated aiming to comply with possible bad, and good, reservoir surprises. This information was used to optimize the development plan of Lula field, which comprises 10 FPSOs with processing capacity ranging from 100k bpd to 150k bpd of oil, and 175 million cubic feet/day to 280 million cubic feet/day of gas. The two pilot production units started operation in 2010 and 2013, respectively, and the first module of Iracema area in Lula Field started production in October 2014. The following FPSOs are expected to be installed in the upcoming years. In a scenario of simultaneous projects under implementation, a clear long lead items strategy is critical to ensure the planned fast-track pace. Also, standardization of subsea equipment and production platforms, in an increasing local content requirement, mitigates supply chain risks and allows resources allocation flexibility. This paper details the key success factors of Lula field development strategy, and show why it is nowadays a reference for the following mega developments that will take place in the Brazilian pre-salt, by combining a risk mitigation strategy with a fast pace production ramp-up, anticipating cash flow funds and maximizing returns.

"85028278319","Improved sustainability performance in increasingly complex business environments is a challenging task for organizations operating in many different industries. In the offshore oil and gas industry, the use of potentially hazardous materials and operation under progressively hostile environments increases the risk of major accidents. Regulators have been trying to catch up on the design of regulatory frameworks that prevent these types of events, aiming to protect people, assets, and the environment. Although there are some recommended practices that companies have been using as the basis for their process safety management systems (PSMS), lack of uniformity and inefficient enforcement remain as two fundamental problems. This paper explores these two problems and takes some first steps toward a broader discussion about these important issues. We draw from the literature on sustainable operations to develop a descriptive case study of the offshore oil and gas industry by employing document analysis and an analysis of the Health, Safety and Environment Management System (HSEMS) of Petrobras, a world leader energy company.

(eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 780-784. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The coastal environment is constantly affected by materials of anthropogenic origin, among which are microplastics. Microplastics are particles smaller than 5 mm that are derived (or not) from the fragmentation of larger plastics. They are carried by currents and tides and deposited along the shoreline, and are mixed with the sediment. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of microplastics in depth within the sediment of five river-estuarine beaches located in Cotijuba Island, in the Pará River estuary (Brazil): PedraBranca, Vai-Quem-Quer, Flexeira, Farol, and Fazendinha. Sediment samples were collected at the high tide line and at three trenches on each beach, with 0.8 m depth, subdivided in four 0.2 m layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 cm). Microplastics were present on all beaches. A total of 13,007 microplastics were counted, of which 99.6% were fibers. Most of them were transparent (38.34 %) and elongated (98.71 %). PedraBranca was the most contaminated beach, with 20,166.7 ± 13,392 particles m . Concerning depth, mean microplastic density was similar among the layers analyzed (0-20 cm =13,416.7 ± 5,070 particles m ; 20-40 cm =10,510.0 ± 8,707 particles m , 40-60 cm=16,005.0 ± 16,011 particles m ; 60-80 cm=9,566.7 ± 1,838 particles m , Kruskal-Wallis, χ2 = 1.34; p = 0.71) regardless of the beach. On PedraBranca, there were higher densities (33,316.7 particles m ± 14,050) on the surface (0-20 cm), and on Flexeira beach, the density was higher (20,300.0 particles m ± 15,230) in bottom layers (60-80 cm). On the other beaches, the highest densities occurred in the 40-60 cm layer, with 25,125.0 ± 21,460 particles m on Vai-Quem-Quer beach, 18,400.0 ± 4,727 particles m on Farol beach, and 9,816.7 ± 16,011particles m on Fazendinha beach.

"85059143234","In passive continental margins, the brittle reactivation of shear zones and their role in the deformation and deposition of sedimentary basins are still a matter of debate. In this research, we investigated the role of the brittle reactivation of Precambrian shear zones in the nucleation of rift and postrift faults in the onshore portion of the Sergipe-Alagoas and Pernambuco basins in northeastern Brazil. We combine and interpret a dataset of aeromagnetic and topographic data, associated with reflection seismic and borehole data, to analyze the evolution of a portion of the Atlantic continental margin of Brazil. Our results indicate that in the crystalline basement, the magnetic lineaments are correlated with ductile structures as shear zones, and the continuity of these lineaments in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Pernambuco basins is interpreted as the shear zones below the sedimentary cover of these basins. We document the following phases of the brittle reactivation of basement shear zones: (1) the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous under an extensional stress regime and (2) tectonic inversion induced by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge push and the Andean Cordillera rise in the Neogene-Quaternary under a predominantly strike-slip stress regime. During the rift phase, the brittle reactivation of the shear zones controlled the locations and architectures of the rifts. These structures acted as zones of weakness and were reactivated as normal faults. The brittle reactivation of shear zones was still active during the postrift phase and was responsible for the development of compressional structures. The reverse faulting and related folding pattern indicate tectonic inversion in the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic. The structures formed during the postrift phase under a strike-slip regime are consistent with the present-day stress field, indicating that tectonic inversion is an active phase of the Brazilian margin. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Basement fabric controls rift nucleation and postrift basin inversion in the continental margin of NE Brazil","Elsevier B.V.",True,"2019"

The search for alternative energy sources has led the scientific community to the oceans, demanding a shift in energetic policies, which must be redefined to favor the development of renewable energy technologies at sea. The goal is to generate electric energy while producing less pollutants or even while using the outputs of human anthropic activities as input for the generation of energy, food, products and for the mitigation of climate change impacts. The present study focus on the Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) technology, which presents the greatest potential for energy exploitation from the oceans and which generates a range of by-products. The South Atlantic Ocean presents the potential to support OTEC plants, with emphasis on the region called Brazilian Ocean Thermal Energy Park, with a total coverage area of 1,893,000.00 km2 and an operating potential of up to 376 OTEC plants.

"84883765236","This study describes the spatial and temporal patterns of changes in the macrobenthic communities of Guajará Bay, an estuary in northern Brazil. Samples were collected at seven sites in the dry (December 2004 and September 2005) and rainy seasons (March and June 2005). On each occasion, four biological samples and one sediment sample were collected at each site using a Petersen grab (0.039 m2). Simultaneously, the pH of the surface water, salinity, electrical conductivity and temperature were measured. Water parameters, except temperature, showed strong seasonal variation. As a general rule, pH, salinity and electrical conductivity were higher in the dry season and increased toward the mouth of the estuary. Sediment characteristics varied little in space or time. Almost 99% of all the specimens collected were annelids. The abundance and diversity of the organisms were significantly higher in the rainy season, when there was a marked increase in the abundance of oligochaetes and insect larvae, whereas polychaetes predominated during the dry season. The results of the ANOSIM indicated significant differences in the composition of the macrofaunal communities between seasons. The groups formed by the CCA reflected the distance from the mouth of the estuary. At the innermost sites, characterized by lower electrical conductivity and rich, organic sandy sediments, oligochaetes predominated, whereas at the sites further downstream, where more saline conditions predominate, polychaetes were found in higher densities. The results indicated that the structure of the macrobenthic communities in this estuarine bay are structured primarily by salinity, and secondarily by seasonal changes in rainfall rates, which affect the characteristics of both the water and sediments. © Coastal Education &amp; Research Foundation 2013.","Macrobenthic communities of an Amazonian estuary (Guajará Bay, Brazil): Temporal and spatial changes",NULL,True,"2013"

But so far, no industrial oil or gas flow is discovered in igneous rocks in Brazilian onshore basins. At present, in some literatures published by some researchers, cases of igneous reservoirs in Brazil are inaccurate. The lithology of reservoirs in the Igarape Cuia oil and gas field, the oil and gas field of Urucu and the Barra Bonita gasfield, were previously thought to be volcanic rocks, but now are clastic rocks according to studies, and the igneous rocks in these three oil and gas field can only be acted as indirect and direct cap rocks. Furthermore, igneous rock reservoirs in the Campos Basin and Santos Basin in the Brazilian offshore are briefly analyzed. The representative Badejo oilfield in the Campos Basin has igneous rock reservoirs dominated by basalts which are intercalated with thin layers of volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks, the storage space are vesicules, fractures and vugular pores, and the porosity of hydrocarbon bearing interval basalt reservoirs ranges from 10% to 15%. In addition, for the Santos Basin, igneous rocks in this basin are dominated by basic rocks, some alkaline intrusive rocks develop good micro spaces, mainly crystal moldic pores, inter- and intra-crystal dissolution pores and fractures, better reservoir intervals are often concentrated such as at sections near to unconformity surfaces and can have porosity of 6%–9% or higher; local pre-salt igneous rock reservoirs in the Santos Basin have the necessary conditions for hydrocarbon accumulation and it will be a new target layer for hydrocarbon exploration. © 2020 Chinese Petroleum Society","Hydrocarbons in igneous rock of Brazil: A review","KeAi Publishing Communications Ltd.",True,"2020"

Floating rig motion caused by waves and swell (""rig heave"") inducessurge and swab when the drillstring issuspended in slips to make up or break a drill pipe connection and topside heave compensation is temporarily deactivated. This is a known issue in regions with harsh weather such as the North Sea, where pressure oscillations of up to 20 bar have been reported during connections. Recorded downhole drilling data from the Carcará field reveals significant pressure oscillations downhole (in the same order of magnitude as in the North Sea) each time the drill string was suspended in slips to make a connection in the sub-salt 8 1/2"" section of the well. Mud losses were experienced around the same well depth and they might have been caused by surge and swab. Measured surge and swab pressure variations have been reproduced in an advanced proprietary surge and swab simulator that considers rig heave, drill pipe elasticity, well friction, non-Newtonian drilling mud, well trajectory and geometry. Moreover, findings in this paper suggest that surge and swab was in fact significantly higher than recorded by the MWD (Measurement While Drilling) tool. The true magnitude of surge and swab is not captured in the recorded MWD data due to low sampling frequency of the downhole pressure recording (one measurement every six seconds, a standard downhole pressure sampling rate used on many operations today). This work showsthatsurge and swab during drill pipe connections on floaters may challenge the available pressure window for some wells even in regions with calm weather such as Brazil. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) is a technique that improves control of the downhole pressure. It is, however, not possible to compensate fast downhole pressure transients, such as heave-induced surge and swab, using MPD choke topside. This is due to the long distance between the choke and the bit, which translates into a time delay in the same order of magnitude as typical wave and heave periods. A downhole choke combined with continuous circulation is one of potential solutions. Surge and swab during drill pipe connections can result in a loss or an influx and should be considered in the well planning phase when mud weight, section lengths, etc. are selected. © MPDU 2020.

The field was developed using subsea completion through the vertical, deviated and horizontal wells, equipped with cased hole and open hole gravel packed screens. Scale formation has occurred as a consequence of the incompatibility between the barium and strontium present in formation water and the high amount of sulfate in the injected seawater. To avoid production losses a plan of water management was implemented, including frequent produced water chemical analyses to investigate the convenience for applying a chemical bullhead treatment to remove scale in the production wells (tubing, screen, gravel pack and near well bore)2,3,4. This paper presents results from dissolver treatments performed in the field and also from a special investigation using a rig in a horizontal well.

Boat tourism is an important marine activity, carrying annually around 150,000 tourists, turning the EPAA into the most visited place to cetacean watch in South America. We describe the experience of managing boat tourism, highlighting the deployment of the Dolphin Monitoring Program. We discuss its strengths and limitations, considering the data from the participatory monitoring conducted since 2014, and from interviews made with all the boat owners. Our results indicate the conflicts among the main stakeholders were reduced, and the monitoring program was able to provide important short-term and intense time-series information on the dolphins’ location and on the boat tourism activity previously unavailable. Notwithstanding, a series of constraints remain, and among others we indicate the need to go beyond the current focus on the commercial benefits of the activity and to combine the participatory monitoring data with those from scientific survey cruises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"33295123","As new oil fields are discovered downslope on the largest Brazilian oil region, Campos Basin, situated on the shelf break and continental slope of eastern South America, new oceanographic challenges are continuously encountered by oceanographers and engineers involved in the design, installation and production of oil field ranging from water depths between 500 to 2000 m. The surface flow in the region is dominated by the Brazil Current, the counterpart of the Gulf Stream as the western boundary current of the South Atlantic gyre. The deep water flow is very complex with different layers of counter currents associated with the rich structure of water masses on this region. This paper discusses the attempts made by PETROBRAS to study the complex flow in the region and produce oil under the harsh environment of deep continental slope regions.

It was decided to install a monitoring system to check the riser design methodology, including Vortex Induced Vibrations (VIV) Analysis. For VIV monitoring, the riser was instrumented with bottles with sophisticated accelerometers in different points, to measure accelerations at a rate of 2 Hz for 300 seconds every 3 hours. The other monitoring systems installed are the oceanographic buoy, to measure waves (height, period and direction), surface current (value and direction), wind, pressures, etc. and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiles (ADCP) to measure instantaneously the current (velocity and direction) along the water column. There is a positioning system (PETRONAV) consisting of GPS receiver with phase correction blended with inertial sensors by a Kalman Filter to measure platform precise absolute positions and movements. All these systems are synchronized to acquire data at the same period of time, to make possible the reanalysis with more reality.

"84963819657","We investigate the role of reactivation of Precambrian basement fabric in the tectono-sedimentary and geomorphological evolution of the Paraíba Basin, continental margin of northeastern Brazil, during the Cretaceous, Neogene, and Quaternary. This basin represents part of the last bridge between South America and Africa before the last breakup stage of the South Atlantic rifting in the early Cretaceous. The Paraíba Basin infill is composed of siliciclastic and carbonate Cretaceous units, as well as aeolian, fluvial and marine Quaternary units. We used shuttle radar imagery, aeromagnetic, wellbore and field data. The reduced-to-the-pole magnetic map (RTP) indicates the continuity of the steeply dipping Precambrian basement shear zones beneath the Paraíba Basin. The combined analysis of surface and subsurface data shows that NE–SW and E–W-striking shear zones were subjected to brittle reactivation in the Aptian–Middle Albian during the basin opening and again in the Neogene–Quaternary, forming a system of horsts and grabens along the basin; some of these structures such as the E–W-oriented Pernambuco shear zone present modern-day seismicity. N–S- and mainly NW–SE-striking transfer faults cut across Aptian–Middle Albian to Neogene–Quaternary strata. These four main fault directions control main river channels and alluvial valleys up to 2 km wide. Topographic breaks up to 50 m were created by late reactivation of rift faults, which mark the boundary between horsts and grabens along the basin. In addition, structural data evidence syn-tectonic faulting with vertical offsets up to 80 m in the Cretaceous and up to 70 m in the Neogene–Quaternary. We conclude that shear zones across the study area are long-lived structures that have behaved as weakness zones. Their neotectonic brittle reactivation has controlled sediment deposition and landform development, which continued through the Neogene–Quaternary. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Neogene–Quaternary fault reactivation influences coastal basin sedimentation and landform in the continental margin of NE Brazil","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2017"
"85075661667","Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are membrane lipids produced by bacteria usually ascribed to soil and peat deposits. The presence of brGDGTs in marine sediments can thus be used to track terrigenous organic matter inputs to the continental margin and to infer the local continental mean annual air temperature (MAT) and soil pH. The proxy rationale is based on the degree methylation and cyclization of the brGDGTs from terrestrial bacteria, but recently evidence was found of river and oceanic production of brGDGTs with similar configuration, indicating the necessity to better constrain the applicability of the soil brGDGTs in the marine realm. Here we considered crenarchaeol and brGDGTs obtained in 46 core-top sediments from cross-margin transects in the Campos Basin in the Southwest Atlantic, with the goal to evaluate the effectiveness of the brGDGT-associated proxies in a region in the southeastern tropical Brazilian continental margin influenced by upwelling events and low terrigenous inputs. The separation of the 5- and 6-methyl brGDGTs proved to be essential for a better evaluation of the sources of brGDGTs in the environment. Direct evidence of input of terrigenous organic matter by the medium-sized Paraíba do Sul River and other small rivers in the region were observed. More importantly, the high proportions of ring-containing brGDGTs—and the consequent increased values of the #ringstetra–in the sediments deposited between 75 and 400 m water depths (mid-shelf to upper slope) were clear evidence of marine in situ production of brGDGTs. In some stations deeper than 1,900 m, an increase in the acyclic 6-methyl hexamethylated compounds can also be ascribed to in situ production. Our results revealed that the initial soil signal is lost during transport and after river discharge in the Campos Basin, which compromise the use of brGDGTs to reconstruct the soil pH and MAT of the nearby land area. © Copyright © 2019 Ceccopieri, Carreira, Wagener, Hefter and Mollenhauer.","Branched GDGTs as Proxies in Surface Sediments From the South-Eastern Brazilian Continental Margin","Frontiers Media S.A.",True,"2019"

The combination of maps and data analysis provided a new geomorphic feature classification of the region. At least four reef steps occur at five paleo-terrace boundaries. Additionally, a new shelf valley location is defined at shallow depths that is connected to a submerged paleo-coastal lagoon at approximately −20 m, fronted by a paleo-spit, and backed by a possible beach ridge.

"84897449140","Well integrity has always been a major concern during the well design phase. But after some of the recent events in the oil industry, Macondo being the one still fresh in everyone's mind, it has turned into a critical concern. The need for monitoring well integrity, from the construction through its lifetime, became unavoidable. In particular, for Petrobras Pre-Salt fields, these concerns are boosted by the uncertainties in the salt layer geomechanical properties and its interaction with the cement and casing. Wells in the Pre-salt are designed for a 30 year lifespan, with a minimum number of interventions during their lifespan. Indeed, the expected interval between interventions is not shorter than 10 years, even for recompletion, making traditional cement or casing logging tools less useful. Continuous monitoring may provide not only the current status of the casing or cementing but also the evolution of the parameters, allowing a condition based (predictive) intervention to be planned. A research and development project is being conducted to investigate, design and evaluate continuous monitoring tools to verify and ensure the integrity of the cement sheath and of the casing. The first and more obvious challenge is to install sensors in the casing annulus: there are severe restrictions in footprint of the components; there is also the problem of getting the data to the surface without compromising well safety barriers. The required metrology need to be investigated in order to determine the best sensing technology for each parameter, and even those must be determined to achieve the best correlation with well integrity status. This paper discusses the current perspectives on the monitoring of well integrity. Parameters already identified and some alternatives to monitor them will also be presented.

"85086649140","Channel-bend expansion and downstream translation, as well as vertical movements by aggradation and incision, set the stratigraphic architecture of channelized depositional systems. Early work on submarine-channel evolution has suggested that downstream translation is rare. It is proposed here that downstream translation of bends might be common in deep-water salt-tectonic provinces, where complex topography can localize channel pathways that promote meander cutoffs and the generation of high-curvature bends. Three-dimensional seismic-reflection data from a region with salt-influenced topography in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil, is used to characterize the structural geometry of a salt diapir and stratigraphic architecture of an adjacent submarine-channel system that extends for 18 km. The combined structural and stratigraphic evolution is interpreted, including meander-cutoff development near the salt diapir followed by ~10 km of downstream translation of a channel bend. The stratigraphic evolution is tested with a simple numerical model of channel meandering. This integrated subsurface characterization and stratigraphic modelling study sheds light on the processes and controls of submarine-channel downstream translation, which might be common in rapidly deforming settings, such as salt basins, that promote localized subsidence, meander cutoffs, and rapidly translating, high-curvature bends. © 2019 The Authors.

"85075951728","The Santo Antônio Bank (SAB) is a large sand accumulation on the inner continental shelf of Salvador City, next to Todos os Santos Bay (TSB) entrance, eastern Brazilian coast. Since the sixteenth century, chroniclers report this feature as a navigational hazard. Previous studies have tried to determine the origin and volume of sands stored within this feature without success. In the present study, high-resolution shallow seismic surveys were used to investigate the architecture, origin, and evolution of the SAB. One hundred seventy kilometers of high resolution shallow seismic lines was acquired during December 2014 and February 2015 using a Meridata® sparker system operating on frequencies between 0.3 and 1.5 kHz, with a maximum 200 J of energy. Three major stratigraphic units were identified: the bedrock, a transgressive unit, and a highstand unit. The bedrock comprises sedimentary rocks of the Northern Camamu Sedimentary Basin and high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Precambrian basement. The transgressive unit is interpreted as the result of deposition in an estuarine environment infilling incised valleys. The highstand unit represents the SAB itself. A well-preserved proto-bank exists at the core of the SAB marking the early stages of bank development. This proto-bank drowned in place possibly during the 8.2-ka event. Present-day SAB and tidal prism volumes show that the bank reached a maturity phase of development. The volume of siliciclastic sands stored in the SAB is 5.98 × 108 m3. The SAB is potentially a major source of sands for beach nourishment for the urban beaches of the city of Salvador and metropolitan area, thus increasing the resilience of the city to future sea-level rises. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","The Santo Antônio Bank: a high-resolution seismic study of a deflected ebb-tidal delta located at the entrance of a large tropical bay, eastern Brazil","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",True,"2020"

That does not count the trade and investment activity that follows in their wake, supplying goods and services to the E & P firms. Globalization has changed the sector, however.

"85085778651","In the Peregrino field, located in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil, the operator adopted the use of water-based drilling fluids for drilling development wells due to rig limitations. In the 12 ¼-in. sections of several wells drilled in this field, high dispersion of shale minerals suffered by the drilling fluid caused increments of viscosity, which subsequently affected the drilling process through higher-than-expected circulation pressures, dilution rates, and costs. Although the wells have been drilled within the estimated times and budgets, an improvement in the fluid inhibition capability was initiated. A detailed laboratory effort was conducted to obtain a combination of inhibitors capable of controlling excessive clay dispersion, minimizing fluid rock interaction, and reducing dilution requirements while helping to ensure an adequate rheological profile throughout the interval. Laboratory validation of the interaction between the fluid and rock samples provided a better understanding of the inhibition mechanisms and helped ensure that stability of the reactive minerals drilled could be maintained. Various additives were tested against samples of commercial-reactive and field-reactive clays. Product concentrations were adjusted to reduce the interaction between the drilling fluid and the formation while helping to ensure that fluid capabilities, such as cuttings suspension, filtration control, and bridging, were maintained. An adequate environmental profile to enable safe disposal of fluid in compliance with local environmental regulations was also obtained. After identifying an adequate solution, a detailed utilization plan was developed and put in place. To aid proper deployment while drilling, specific mixing procedures at the support liquid mud plant, transportation vessels, and at the rig site were determined. The next step was to assign a candidate well for the application - an Extended Reach Well (ERW) with step-out ratio of 2.9. While drilling the 12-¼-in. section of the pilot well with the proposed fluid technology, a significant improvement was observed on cuttings integrity, which led to a reduction in the required volume of dilution and a subsequent drilling fluids cost reduction Also, better hole quality and reduced operational risks were obtained. The well was safely drilled with a 76° sail inclination, 7938 meters of Measured Depth (MD) and 2368 meters of True Vertical Depth (TVD), and lessons learned from the first utilization of the described fluid system were implemented on subsequent wells to continue obtaining the benefits of the new fluid formulation.

A data set of 448 MICP from the Pre-Salt carbonates of Barra Velha Formation was used to build the FZI-RRT model.

"85068049608","The conditions under which lead firms will invest in upgrading suppliers occupy center stage in the debates about how global value chains (GVCs) affect development and what room is left for governments to adopt industrial policies. In a key industry for developing economies, oil and gas (O&G), the maps of oil production and value chain have been redrawn by the growth of production from high-cost resources, which means that an increasing share of the value of oil production is to be found in the supply of capital goods and services rather than in the ownership of the land. This has opened up new possibilities for industrial policy in the form of local-content requirements, regulations through which governments influence how lead firms (oil companies) structure their supply chain. This chapter analyzes the conditions under which local-content regulations can lead to domestic supplier upgrading and characterizes the value chain of O&G. Empirical support is provided by a deep case study of Brazil, a country that is rich in technically complex and costly deep-offshore oil and that has adopted policies to promote its supply industry. Based on analyses of an industry where local firms were pushed towards diversification in a new chain (shipbuilding), data from more than 23,000 contracts of Petrobras, and audit reports of local-content compliance, this chapter shows that, consistent with theoretical expectations, new local suppliers required high monitoring costs and struggled to reach international productivity levels, partly because Brazil’s policy requirements have been set too far beyond the capacity of the domestic industry. Together, the findings also highlight the sustainability challenges of pursuing an industrial policy dependent on a single lead firm (Petrobras), with captive governance of the supply chain, and in a context of political rent seeking. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Elisabeth B.

Exploration in the deep water part of the basin has been sparse (only 5 wells in water depth greater than 1000 m to date) with some success but, most importantly, de-risked the working petroleum system. With significant part of the deep water acreage licensed to operators in the 11th bid round in 2013, the basin is now embarking on a new exciting phase of exploration. Cear basin sedimentary fill is divided into three mega-sequences: syn-rift, transitional and drift. The basin is blessed with world-class source rocks of Aptian to Turonian age developed within all three main megasequences. The Transitional megasequence contains both the source rocks and the reservoirs. This play was tested by the Pecem discovery in 2012 by Petrobras on the flank of a large structural high. Reservoir quality and connectivity remain the main uncertainty for this play. Other plays include a structural play with reservoirs in the syn-rift sandstones (Munda formation), and the Upper Cretaceous turbidite slope channel/canyons. In addition, in the outboard blocks onlap wedge plays in the Transitional early lower part of the drift megasequence have been identified. These plays could be analogous to the successfully tested plays on the conjugate margin in West Africa.

The aim was to assess the impacts of the newly built water diversion channel, as well as the effects of a flood and tracer transport from an intermittent tributary, both located in the bay. An alternative approach to estimate the water retention times was additionally implemented. The simulations showed that though the diversion channel did not significantly influence the hydrodynamics of the bay, it is necessary to continuously monitor water quality parameters in the withdrawal, especially during rainy periods after droughts, because of the nutrient inputs from the tributary and the overflows of the nearby drainage systems. Management measures adapting to the continuously changing natural conditions and anthropogenic impacts are thus indispensable and the model presented can be a valuable supporting tool for this purpose. © IWA Publishing 2019 Jo.","Modeling the impacts of climate extremes and multiple water uses to support water management in the Icó-Mandantes Bay, Northeast Brazil","IWA Publishing",True,"2019"

"77955388680","The lastest discoveries of oil and gas reserves in the Brazilian offshore area present new challenges on gas transportation due to their location, far away from the coast. For these new scenarios, Floating Liquefied Natural Gas (FLNG) units may be a good solution for a natural gas volume production around 2.5 MTPA. It is worth saying that this technology hasn't been proved yet. So, there are many challenges to overcome to turn the FLNG into an economically and technically feasible solution for these new scenarios. One of the main challenges for establishing a LNG (liquefied natural gas) offshore unit is the definition of the liquefaction process technology to be used. Characteristics such as motion effects, footprint, robustness, operational flexibility and asiness, safety, maintenance and availability must be considered when the main differences between the processes are being identified. Depending on the capacity to be attended, liquefaction processes may use hydrocarbon refrigerant mixtures or inert refrigerant fluids. Due to the environmental conditions in Brazilian waters, side-by-side offloading operations are not possible, as the operational availability would not be large enough. Therefore, LNG offloading would only be achieved through the tandem operational mode. Since the technology available for this kind of operation uses aerial hoses, it will be necessary to provide a bow loading system (BLS) installed on the LNG carrier and also a dynamic positioning system (DP) may be needed for an accurate control of the positioning and maintenance of a relative heading. The study indicates that the cargo containment system (CCS) should fulfill some constraints: let free upper deck area for topsides facilities; withstand any partial filling condition (sloshing impacts); have a good track record; and its configuration should allow inspection and maintenance in the offshore environment. This paper reports the Petrobras findings on the evaluating of the FLNG technology. Petrobras considers the FLNG unit an attractive option for its scenario, although many sub-systems still present important challenges in order to achieve a good overall performance. The choice of the best technology for each sub-system is still on-going, aiming the largest reliability and the minimum cost possible.

Many authors already use this integrated method to investigate interest areas in, both, commercial and scientific aspect. In this direction the current study initiated in 2009 in the frame of the Geochemistry Network PETROBRAS/CENPES, aims to track the quaternary evolution of a muddy bank situated at the coastal western boundary upwelling system (WBUS) off Cabo Frio (23oS) in the Atlantic Ocean. The WBUS is located at the north coast of the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Here the coastline orientation differs from the default East-West direction of the Brazilian coast, concomitant with the boundary of the Campos and Santos Basins, the most important oil and gas basins of the country. The upwelling phenomenon occurs due to constant northeast winds. The same winds combined with the Northeast-Southwest coastline orientation also promote a curl confluence making the environment even more complex. Seismic data was acquired in cruises on board the RV Ocean Survey. Altogether 680 km was covered by a 3.5 KHz sub-bottom using the Geopulse Geoacustic System. Further, four piston cores were collected to be scan and described in physic parameters and sedimentological content, respectively. The scan was performed using a Geotek Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL), which measure and register the Vp, gamma density and porosity of the core. After the scan, the cores were sample and analyzed on sedimentological grain size distribution determined by a Cilas 1064 laser analyzer. The results were integrated in order to identify common trends. Three major echo-characters were described in seismic records. Grain size analysis presented a good relationship with these echos. Echo A) Transparent, represented by a sharp bottom reflector with no sub-bottom reflectors scatter of a transparent layer mapped in seismic records. The grain size distribution is more balanced with a slight higher content of sands (55 %) in the correspondent core. Echo B) Stratified described as a series of parallel sub-bottom horizons, its percentage of clays is the highest of the three cores (77 %). The last echo, C) Reflexive, is a prolonged echo with one or none sub-bottom reflector. This echo is related to the highest percentage of sands of the three cores (61%). The sediment analysis was extrapolated all over the echo-characters extension to understand the transport regime over the area. This criteria, allied to isopach map, made possible to recognize three distinct zones inside the muddy accumulation. © 2013 IEEE.","Echo-character identification and grain size analysis of the upwelling system of Cabo Frio, RJ","IEEE Computer Society",True,"2013"
"80052571318","The application of the recent technique of creating lateral tunnels by acid jetting into the formation has been a topic of discussion in Petrobras because it is a reliable, fast an economic way to increase the well productivity index in complex geology carbonate reservoirs. In order to evaluate this technology, a pioneer intervention was carried out in the Garoupa field on a typical offshore well in Brazil. The objective was to simultaneously increase oil production and decrease water cut, by creating lateral tunnels at specific points in the well open hole section. The number of tunnels created as well as their positions were defined as a function of both, oil and water saturation profiles. Also mineralogical and geomechanical analysis were conducted as well as rock dissolution on different hydrochloric acid concentrations, in order to determine tunnel perforation rate and hole stability, The application of this technology has generated important incomes to the oil operator and the same technique could be also applied on other different scenarios.

"85009433339","The Piúma lineament, located in the Southern Espírito Santo State, Brazil, is one of the most prominent linear morphostructural features of the northern Mantiqueira Province. The lineament stands out in satellite images and topographic maps, extending for about 70 km in a N50°W direction, between the towns of Iconha and Conceição do Castelo (Espírito Santo). In order to investigate the nature and role played by the Piúma lineament in the tectonic evolution of the Mantiqueira Province and adjacent Campos Basin, we carried out a detailed structural analysis based on fieldwork, as well as geophysical data processing and interpretation. The results we obtained indicate that the Piúma lineament is a brittle shear zone characterized by N50W-trending and SW-dipping shear fractures, faults and joints. These structures record two distinct and incompatible motions, thereby recording the operation of two tectonic regimes: NNE-SSW extension and E-W transtension. Comparing our results with the literature on the Southeastern Brazilian Continental Margin, we conclude that the Piúma lineament more likely developed after the Ediacaran Brasiliano orogenic event in response to an NNE-SSW extension, experiencing later a reactivation as normal dextral to dextral transtensional zone, probably in connection with the South Atlantic rifting in the Lower Cretaceous.","The Piúma lineament, southern Espirito Santo: Structural expression and tectonic significance","Sociedade Brasileira de Geologia",True,"2016"

"85101031678","Many sedimentary basins host thick evaporite (salt) deposits. Some of these basins also host extensive igneous intrusion networks. It thus seems inevitable that, in some locations, magma will interact with salt. Yet how interaction between these materials may influence salt tectonics or magma emplacement, particularly at the basin-scale, remains poorly understood. We use 3D seismic reflection data from the Santos Basin, offshore Brazil to image 38 igneous intrusions spatially related to thick Aptian salt. Based on identified seismic–stratigraphic relationships, we suggest sill emplacement likely occurred during the late Albian-to-Santonian. We show intra-salt sills are geometrically similar to but laterally offset from supra-salt sills. We suggest ascending magma was arrested by the salt in some areas, but not others, perhaps due to differences in evaporite lithology. Our mapping also reveals most sills occur within and above the presalt Merluza Graben, an area characterized by Albian-to-Neogene, salt-detached extension. In adjacent areas, where there are few intrusions, salt deformation was driven by post-Santonian diapir rise. We suggest emplacement of hot magma within evaporites above the Merluza Graben enhanced Albian-to-Santonian salt movement, but that crystallization of the intrusion network restricted post-Santonian diapirism. Our work indicates salt–magma interaction can influence salt tectonics, as well as the distribution of magma plumbing systems, and thus could impact basin evolution. © 2021 The Authors.

"85085773745","CO2-WAG (Water-Alternating-Gas) has been applied in offshore Brazilian oilfields to improve recovery rates and mitigate the environmental impact that venting produced CO2 would bring. Although CO2 is highly miscible in oil under these reservoirs conditions, this gas is also extremely mobile, and its speciation in the aqueous phase drives reactions with carbonates that can cause severe inorganic scaling problems in production systems. It is crucial, therefore, to effectively design CO2-WAG operations for mobility control and, consequently, enhance reservoir performance, CO2 utilization and flow assurance. This paper addresses the design optimization of coupled CO2-EOR and storage operations applied to the Brazilian Pre-salt offshore context (reservoir properties, infrastructure, regulatory framework and economic characteristics), examining the trade-offs of project profitability, CO2 utilization and calcite scale risk. Several compositional simulations of miscible WAG scenarios were performed and key design parameters were optimized using statistical sampling and evolutionary algorithms. Aqueous and mineral reactions were included in the calculations, allowing us to quantify the calcite mass that can potentially deposit in the perforations and production system. The results showed how optimizing WAG operations can significantly improve the economics and the scale management of oil production from carbonate reservoirs. The optimal WAG design greatly increased incremental NPV per volume of CO2 stored and reduced calcite scale risk by simply rearranging the WAG slugs in a tapered manner. Here we demonstrate that this methodology can be used to determine how to recycle CO2 in a given field for better economics and lower carbon footprint, doing so without triggering calcite mineral deposition to the point of permanent jeopardy of production wells and facilities operability. Therefore, the workflow integrates critical challenges that are correlated, yet often addressed independently, supporting the complex decision-making of CO2-EOR operational design in carbonate reservoirs. © 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","Optimization of CO2-WAG and calcite scale management in pre-salt carbonate reservoirs","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"85055027444","In order to comply with ANP / INMETRO No. 1 regulations, Petrobras undertook a project to install fiscal flow meters on its gas pipelines located on its Marlin Asset platforms in the Campos Basin. However, meter installation required 15 days of shutdown on each platform, which would reduce production rates. A technology was needed to minimize shutdown time and maximize revenues; Petrobras selected Hot Tapping and Plugging with a Bypass arrangement. Hot Tapping and Plugging with Bypass procedures isolates a section of the pipe through the installation of temporary STOPPLES that are inserted into the pipe through hot taps made on in-line welded fittings. Using distinct fittings upstream and downstream of the section, it was possible to install a by-pass that allows the normal pipeline flow to remain uninterupted. This procedure allowed the installation of the flow meters on the gas lines and flare lines of 6 Marlin asset platforms on the Campos Basin with no shutdown between February and October 2006. The project lasted for a full year and included planning, engineering design, preliminary inspection, fittings in-line welding, hot tapping and plugging and the installation of 27 flow meters. No production time was lost. A technology taskforce was formed to develop and approve the STOPPLE procedure, since no previous Petrobras standard existed prior to this project. All safety and technical issues were studied and developed to comply with Petrobras safety and quality standards.

"85104631395","The Pará-Maranhão/Barreirinhas margin, North Brazil, is a pull-apart passive margin, with two strike-slip borders, formed during the opening of the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean during Cretaceous time. Its geometry and evolution are speculative due to the lack of information on the crustal structure and the crustal nature. We present here the E-W profiles of the MAGIC (Margins of brAzil, Ghana and Ivory Coast) deep seismic experiment, a joint project between French and Brazilian universities, research institutes and the industry. Fifty-six Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and a 4.5 seismic streamer were deployed at sea along 2 of the 5 MAGIC profiles. One profile was extended onshore by installing 8 land stations. We perform forward modelling through combined interpretation of the multichannel seismic and of the main reflected and refracted of these phases recorded by the OBSs. The final P-wave velocity models reveal distinct structural domains from onshore Brazil towards the Atlantic Ocean characterized by variations of the crustal thicknesses and velocities: (1) an unthinned continental crust below the São Luís Craton, where the crust is 33 km thick, (2) a 60 km wide necking domain below the Ilha de Santana Platform; (3) offshore, east of the continental slope, a 10 km-thick deep sedimentary basin underlain by a 5 km thick crust with velocity of 6.2–6.9 km/s that we interpret as an exhumed lower continental crust, on the top of an Anomalous Velocity Layer (AVL) probably made of intrusions of mantle-derived melts into the lower continental crust, or a mixture of them; (4) eastwards, the limit of the previous domain is marked by NW-SE aligned volcanoes and the disappearance of the AVL. The sedimentary succession becomes thinner (6 km) overlaying a proto-oceanic crust characterized by seismic velocities higher than “normal” oceanic crust in its upper part, but in continuity with the velocity described in the previous domain; (5) followed by a more characteristic but thin oceanic crust. The middle/lower continental crust seems not only to have a crucial role in the genesis of the passive margin but also to be involved in the genesis of the first oceanic crust. The passage to a typical oceanic crust seems to have occurred progressively by steps: first in the deeper layer by the setup of more and more intrusions of mantle-derived melts at the base of the crust or mixture of exhumed lower crust and mantle, producing a domain of proto-oceanic crust, then by the emplacement of an upper 1-2 km-thick layer with typical oceanic characteristics. © 2021","Deep structure of the Pará-Maranhão/Barreirinhas passive margin in the equatorial Atlantic (NE Brazil)","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2021"

"85007282651","The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions.

"85043311576","Marine parks constitute important areas for the conservation of marine life and the genetic heritage around the world. The creation of such marine parks must be accompanied by careful measures to guarantee the coexistence of natural biota and human activities in these systems. The State Marine Park of Laje de Santos (SMPLS) is so close to an industrial pole and urban area that its creation and maintenance is an example for humanity. However, no program has yet been installed for the monitoring of its biotic and abiotic water parameters. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide hydrological and hydrochemical parameters with emphasis on dissolved nutrients to establish a starting point for the monitoring of these waters. The presence of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) in the marine park during the spring and summer sampling periods was evidenced by the observation of low temperatures (&lt; 17ºC) associated with salinity around 35 at the bottom of the water column, indicating a thermohaline feature. The dissolved oxygen presented high values, with few data below 4 mL L-1 occurring at the bottom of the water column. The pH was always in accordance with marine values (~8). Dissolved silicate and phosphate presented high values associated with inputs from the SACW intrusion, continental runoff and bottom resuspension processes, reaching maximum values of 15.86 and 1.23 µmol L-1, respectively. Nitrogen compounds were also associated with a natural fertilization process by the presence of the SACW at the bottom of the water column, as evidenced by the high nitrate concentrations (&gt; 7.00 µmol L-1), while the concentration of N-ammonium (maximum 9.86 µmol L-1) demonstrated a rapid regeneration of the organic matter, mainly in the euphotic zone.

On the basis of petroleum geochemical proxies, an integrated approach was developed using source rock characterizations to establish the distribution of source rock properties, such as organic matter content, hydrocarbon-generating potential, thermal maturity and stratigraphic thickness. The outcomes of a comprehensive petroleum geochemical characterization were integrated with cuttings and core sample descriptions, biostratigraphic controls, well log analyses and 2-D/3-D seismic interpretations. Our results reveal that for the Albian-Oligocene deposits, the key geochemical properties required to develop hydrocarbon source kitchens converge in specific locations, demonstrating a variable hydrocarbon potential ranging from poor to excellent and suggesting the existence of local generation pods in the central and principally northern portions of the research area. The accumulation and preservation of the organic matter were influenced by the paleo-topography and tectonic controls, and the lowest concentrations of organic carbon were attributed to significant siliciclastic dilution taking place mostly toward the middle and southern portions of the Eastern Marlim oilfield. Lateral variations in both the lithofacies and organic facies are the main conditions controlling the behavior of the petroleum potential in the investigated sediments. Our results indicate that the Macaé Group has sufficient source-rock potential, maturation patterns, and hydrocarbon-generating potential to be considered as an active source rock in the Eastern Marlim oilfield, where the petroleum geochemical properties converge and are adequate to generate hydrocarbon compounds.

"85085775962","Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injection is an enhanced recovery method that is being applied in some brazilian offshore oilfields as an alternative to combine effective pressure maintenance policies, flexible produced gas management strategies and increased recoveries. In this technology, gas plays the role of reducing residual oil saturation while water controls, by multiphase flow-in-porous-medium effects, gas adverse mobility. In addition to the extra engineering tasks needed to design development plans and production facilities, an intense characterization programme should be put in practice in order to reduce risks, increase predictability and optimize WAG floods. Much more complex laboratory tests than the ones usually performed for continuous water/gas floods should be done, particularly to tackle multiphase flow in porous medium phenomena. The proper characterization, modeling and simulation of these effects are vital for a representative WAG design and evaluation.

Firstly, it summarizes the best relative permeability hysteresis model (Larsen & Skauge) available in most commercial reservoir simulators. Then, it describes a special laboratory WAG multiphase flow-in-porous-media characterization program, designed and executed to obtain the parameters of this hysteresis model. Experiments were done at reservoir conditions and with rock and fluids from an actual offshore field. Following, results of these tests were evaluated in light of Larsen & Skauge model, in order to confirm its validity. Finally, WAG simulations of a sector of the target field were performed to access the impacts of including or neglecting relative permeability hysteresis phenomena. Conclusions of this work contribute to increase predictability and reduce uncertainties related to field-scale implementation of WAG technology. Knowledge acquired from this study promoted a better estimation of oil recovery, gas production and overriding. It also supports the design of subsea and topside equipment, which is critical in the offshore scenario. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference","An integrated WAG characterization study for an offshore oilfield","Offshore Technology Conference",True,"2020"
"85073706024","As an offshore oil well ages, it is common for the production system to face multiphase flow problems such as limit cycles. This phenomenon, known as slugging in the jargon of the oil industry, causes oscillations in the well's flowrate and pressure. Its main effects are reducing production and increasing the risk of operational discontinuity due to shut down. In this paper, an advanced control process (APC) strategy is presented to deal with the slugging problem in oil wells. The strategy uses a two-layer coupled control structure: a regulatory via a PID control, and a supervisory via a model-based predictive control (MPC). The structure proposed was applied to a real ultra-deepwater well in Petrobras that was partially restricted by the choke valve to avoid the propagation of oscillatory behavior to the production system. As a result, the well has achieved a 10% oil production increase while maintaining the flow free of severe slugging, which meant an increment of about 240 barrels a day for that specific well. © 2019","10% increase in oil production through a field applied APC in a petrobras ultra-deepwater well","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2019"

"85090367193","When performing classic uncertainty reduction according to dynamic data, a large number of reservoir simulations need to be evaluated at high computational cost. As an alternative, we construct Bayesian emulators that mimic the dominant behavior of the reservoir simulator, and which are several orders of magnitude faster to evaluate. We combine these emulators within an iterative procedure that involves substantial but appropriate dimensional reduction of the output space (which represents the reservoir physical behavior, such as production data), enabling a more effective and efficient uncertainty reduction on the input space (representing uncertain reservoir parameters) than traditional methods, and with a more comprehensive understanding of the associated uncertainties. This study uses the emulation-based Bayesian history-matching (BHM) uncertainty analysis for the uncertainty reduction of complex models, which is designed to address problems with a high number of both input and output parameters. We detail how to efficiently choose sets of outputs that are suitable for emulation and that are highly informative to reduce the input-parameter space and investigate different classes of outputs and objective functions. We use output emulators and implausibility analysis iteratively to perform uncertainty reduction in the input-parameter space, and we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of certain popular classes of objective functions in this context. We demonstrate our approach through an application to a benchmark synthetic model (built using public data from a Brazilian offshore field) in an early stage of development using 4 years of historical data and four producers. This study investigates traditional simulation outputs (e.g., production data) and also novel classes of outputs, such as misfit indices and summaries of outputs. We show that despite there being a large number (2,136) of possible outputs, only very few (16) were sufficient to represent the available information; these informative outputs were used using fast and efficient emulators at each iteration (or wave) of the history match to perform the uncertainty-reduction procedure successfully. Using this small set of outputs, we were able to substantially reduce the input space by removing 99.8% of the original volume. We found that a small set of physically meaningful individual production outputs were the most informative at early waves, which once emulated, resulted in the highest uncertainty reduction in the input-parameter space, while more complex but popular objective functions that combine several outputs were only modestly useful at later waves. The latter point is because objective functions such as misfit indices have complex surfaces that can lead to low-quality emulators and hence result in noninformative outputs. We present an iterative emulator-based Bayesian uncertainty-reduction process in which all possible input-parameter configurations that lead to statistically acceptable matches between the simulated and observed data are identified. This methodology presents four central characteristics: incorporation of a powerful dimension reduction on the output space, resulting in significantly increased efficiency; effective reduction of the input space; computational efficiency, and provision of a better understanding of the complex geometry of the input and output spaces.

"33745354316","Since May 2001 PETROBRAS is using spacebome multi-sensor remote sensing for its sea surface monitoring program at the Campos, Santos and Espirito Santo Basins, southeastern Brazilian coast. Ocean color (SeaWiFS and MODIS), thermal infrared (NOAA/AVHRR), scatterometer (QuikSCAT) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (RADARSAT-1 and ENVISAT) data were integrated in order to detect and characterize different sorts of marine pollution and meteo-oceanographic phenomena. The near real time processing and delivery of the SAR data allowed the timely in-situ verification and sampling of the remotely detected events. Satellite sensors operating in the visible part of the spectrum are used to monitor ocean color variations and associated biomass changes. Thermal infrared radiometers are ideal to monitor features like oceanic fronts and upwelling plumes. However, the major limitation for both types of sensors is the extensive and persistent presence of clouds in the monitored area. Fortunately, microwave sensors such imaging spaceborne SAR permit the acquisition of oceanic scenes, regardless cloud coverage. With the spaceborne SAR systems available it is possible to have almost a daily synoptic view of large areas with suitable spatial resolution for the detection of different natural and men-made events. The integrated analysis of these dataset presents an important decision tool for emergencies, as well for the elaboration of contingency plans and evaluation of the oil industry activity impacts.

"85075941856","The northeastern Brazilian continental shelf has a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentation system. This study applied statistical analysis on superficial sediments to access the conditions and controls of sedimentary distribution and processes along the outer shelf depositional environment. The total of 123 grabbed sediment samples were analyzed as mean grain size, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The outer shelf presented mean grain size ranging from very coarse sand to very fine sand. Standard deviation ranges from moderately sorted to very poorly sorted. Skewness ranges from strongly fine-skewed to strongly coarse-skewed. Kurtosis intervals range from very platykurtic to very leptokurtic. The bivariant analysis revealed correlations between the statistical parameters and sedimentary facies in three environments: outside the Açu reef (OAR), Açu inter-reef (AIR,) and in the Açu Incised Valley (AIV). The coarse sediments are poorly selected, showed positively skewed essentially, and had the lowest kurtosis values in bioclastic coarse sand of the OAR area related to, whereas medium to fine sands are siliciclastic and bioclastic, moderately sorted, positively skewed, and showed the highest values of kurtosis in the AIR and AIV. The kurtosis and skewness parameters evidenced the distinction between the three zones on the outer shelf.

"84947326315","Three different packages describing the white capping dissipation process, and the corresponding energy input from wind to wave were used to study the surface wave dynamics in South Atlantic Ocean, close to the Brazilian coast. A host of statistical parameters were computed to evaluate the performance of wave model in terms of simulated bulk wave parameters. Wave measurements from a buoy deployed off Santa Catarina Island, Southern Brazil and data along the tracks of Synthetic Aperture Radars were compared with simulated bulk wave parameters; especially significant wave height, for skill assessment of different packages. It has been shown that using a single parameter representing the performance of source and sink terms in the wave model, or relying on data from only one period of simulations for model validation and skill assessment would be misleading. The model sensitivity to input parameters such as time step and grid size were addressed using multiple datasets. The wind data used for the simulation were obtained from two different sources, and provided the opportunity to evaluate the importance of input data quality. The wind speed extracted from remote sensing satellites was compared to wind datasets used for wave modeling. The simulation results showed that the wind quality and its spatial resolution is highly correlated to the quality of model output. Two different sources of wave information along the open boundaries of the model domain were used for skill assessment of a high resolution wave model for the study area. It has been shown, based on the sensitivity analysis, that the effect of using different boundary conditions would decrease as the distance from the open boundary increases; however, the difference were still noticeable at the buoy location which was located 200-300 km away from the model boundaries; but restricted to the narrow band of the low frequency wave spectrum. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Sensitivity of a third generation wave model to wind and boundary condition sources and model physics: A case study from the South Atlantic Ocean off Brazil coast","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2016"

"85085775194","This paper will describe the improvement made to the reamer cutter blocks to enhance its durability and optimize the Pre-salt Well Construction Currently, most of the Brazilian's Pre-Salt wells have the last phase built-in 12.25in. In some situations, it is necessary to drill oil wells in a giant offshore field wells with five phases, enlarging the third phase from 18.125in to 22in. The high abrasiveness encountered at this phase increased the number of runs needed to drill it and, consequently, time and costs that encouraged the development of solutions. This work relates what has been observed during the last years about reaming difficulties, specifically, in the enlargement from 18.125in to 22in when facing abrasive formations. Petrobras specialists analyzed these events and concluded the matrix of the reamer's cutter blocks was wearing faster and losing the capacity to hold the PDC cutters. The hole enlargement company, that Petrobras works for nowadays, developed a process that increased the resistance of the cutter blocks by increasing the hardness of the surface material prior to the brazing of the cutters. Then, Petrobras has had the opportunity to use both modified and common cutter blocks in a challenging operation to compare their durability and the results were completely satisfactory. The modified cutter blocks had much less wearing on the same formations. Based on this operation, we can conclude this process is validated since improved the reamer cutter blocks quality and its lifetime.

However, these new FPSOs designs carried out worldwide concerns about good seakeeping behavior when considering general weather conditions, in order to apply their project to different locations around the globe. Analyzing the Brazilian specific conditions, it was verified that, considering waves, current and wind characteristics, the dimension proportions found in the projected units were not the best options, mostly because of the swell waves influence. Thus, in a cooperative project between University of Sao Paulo and PETROBRAS, the best dimensions for a specific case were studied, based on real premises from Campos Basin. During the study, the roll motion, which usually creates operational limits during hard environmental conditions, was focused. It was possible not only to evaluate the best breath and draught relations, but also the inclusion of a structured skirt in the ship bilge. The influence of different shapes in the ship's bow and stern were also evaluated, showing interesting results regarding the forces applied on the vessel.

These terminals integrate the Petrobras LNG system and are considered to be the best technical and economic solution to make the supply of gas flexible for the markets of thermal and non-thermal generation of energy. The supply of LNG permits modulating the purchase according to demand. The Brazilian natural gas market has the potential to expand and is characterized by a flexible demand associated with generation of electricity and by a stable demand represented by industry, transport, and residential uses. In the Brazilian national electrical energy grid, thermo-electrical energy complements hydropower. About 11% of installed capacity in Brazil is supplied by thermo-electrical plants moved by natural gas and 80% by hydropower. The Petrobras LNG project will be supplied by the international market and the dry season in Brazil in which the demand for LNG increases coincides with a lesser demand in the countries in the Northern Hemisphere, benefiting the country. The use of natural gas in Brazil has increased at 4%/yr avg in recent years and represents 10.46% of the Brazilian energy matrix. Petrobras estimates place the use of natural gas in Brazil in 2011 at 12%. The flexible LNG terminals were designed starting with an unpublished concept, namely, a floating wharf with the capability to receive a supply ship on one side and a regasification ship on the other side. The LNG will arrive by the supply ship, be processed in the regasification ship, and injected into the gas pipeline that connects to the Duque de Caxias (Reduc) refinery to be distributed to the transmission grid. At Pecém, the wharf is connected to an extension of the Gasfor that will connect the gas from the terminal to the state grid. Petrobras has leased two ships to operate with the flexible terminals, the Golar Spirit, with 129,000 cu m of LNG and regasification at 7 million cu m/day, and the Golar Winter, that carries 138,000 cu m of LNG and that can regasify 14 million cu m/day. There is not yet a definite site for the third terminal. The goal is to be able to supply by 2012 LNG of up to 31 million cu m/day, corresponding to what Petrobras imports from Bolivia today.","LNG as a new challenge for Petrobras [GNL: Novo desafio para a Petrobras/GNL: Nuevo desafío para Petrobras]",NULL,True,"2008"

However, in fields with production history, traditional uncertainty analysis, combining possible values of uncertainty variables, can lead to models that poorly represent the reservoir and to results that do not respect the available dynamic data. During uncertainty analysis process, history matching evaluation can considerably reduce the existing uncertainties. The methodology used in this work is based on experimental design and response surfaces. Besides the cumulative production response surface, another one is generated to represent the quality of the history matching. Only cases with a good history matching are selected as input to the Montecarlo simulation. With this technique, it is possible to evaluate the initially defined probability distributions and, if necessary, to redefine shape or limits for the probability density curve. The methodology was applied in a real study in Petrobras. There are uncertainties related to faults, absolute permeability and also related to the existing fluid properties. Although there are other wells in the same block, the studied area is located in a sea-bottom slope region, where water depth varies considerably within the block, possibly influencing the oil quality. Since there are two wells operating in the studied region, one producer and one injector, the developed analysis took the existing dynamic data into account, reducing model uncertainties.

In Ilha Grande Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), traditional small-scale fishers (“Caiçaras”) has struggled to respond to the contemporary challenges of overfishing and territory loss, which emerged, in part, as consequence of biodiversity conservation and development policies implemented over the last fifty years. In this paper, we aim to explore a sustainable territorial development approach to improve quality of life of fishing communities while conserving the land and seascape that they explore. We first look at the past phases of the development trajectory of Ilha Grande Bay in order to plan for the future. Data collection involved analysis of documentary sources, direct observation in decision-making arenas, and semi-structured interviews. We analyzed four periods from the development trajectory, focusing on small-scale fishing. Our findings show that the set of policies reviewed has strengthened the connections between biodiversity loss and poverty over the years. The viability of STD strategies depends on the recognition of the complexity of interactions among fisheries, environmental protection and tourism, and on the need to create a supply chain that adds value to fishery products which sustain livelihoods and has low environmental impact. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Understanding the past to plan for the future: The small-scale fisheries at Ilha Grande Bay, Brazil","Elsevier Ltd",True,"2020"
